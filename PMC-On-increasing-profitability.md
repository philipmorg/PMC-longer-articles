# On Increasing Profitability

Old draft: [Position Paper - Increasing Profitability Without Selling to Fortune 500 Companies v1 - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aklg5GnRghSKttV3H1FlAXKJAK0CXUCWz0HDs79PK1I/edit)

Now let’s look at those routes to greater profitability, specifically the ones that I think are a great match with focusing on the SMB segment. In brief, they are:

1. Digital products
2. Productized services
3. Training
4. Group events, or leveraged time
5. Advice-only retainers

Each of these routes to greater profitability has a different profile in terms of up-front cost to you, cost of delivering the service, ongoing maintenance cost, and the cost of marketing and selling. Here I’m using the word cost as a way to express the time, effort, and accumulated expertise you need to have available to you in order to successfully sell that kind of service. Here’s a quick overview of what these costs tend to look like.

## Digital Products

Digital products are a category of products that are distributed digitally. The usual suspects here include self-published books, training videos or courses, and software components like libraries, templates, themes, and other write-once-use-many pieces of code. Less usual suspects might include less-than-book-length informational products like quick reference guides, cheat sheets, paid newsletters, and the like.

Digital products are often--but not exclusively--sold to individuals rather than to the company. This is almost automatically a less complex sale that requires less of you. Less sales and marketing sophistication, and less lead time to close the sale. Many digital products are priced at "impulse buy" levels, which also lowers the demands on your marketing and sales skills.

From the perspective of developing new business for your _services_, your digital product(s) can function as an emissary that helps pave the way for bigger and better things (your services) down the road. Someone at WidgetCo buys your book, is impressed by your ideas or expertise, and that paves the way for selling services to WidgetCo at some future date. Another way to express this same idea is to think of digital products as inbound marketing, except you actually _get paid_ each time you get a new lead.

### _Sidebar_:

If you start poking around online for information on selling digital products, you’ll notice what I think is a disturbing pattern pretty quickly. It’s a big revenue spike that coincides with a big internet marketing-style launch, followed by a long slow slide into trivial sales numbers. This pattern is so common that you’d almost get the idea it’s the only way digital product sales actually work.

I don’t think it’s the _only_ way this can work. Digital products can generate real long-term revenue. 

Since I figured out how to sell it (which admittedly took about a year) my book _[The Positioning Manual for Technical Firms](http://thepositioningmanual.com)_ has sold a steady $2,800/mo. It’s interesting to think about this book as a sort of annuity.

What kind of investment would you have to make to generate that much return? At 3.06% (current yield for Vanguard High Yield ETF), you’d have to invest $1.1 million to yield $2,805/mo of interest.  While $2,800/mo may not seem like life-changing revenue, most people would describe $1.1 million in the bank as life-changing money. 

Sure, the two aren’t exactly equivalent from a liquidity and net worth perspective and yes, the 1.1 mil offers options the book doesn’t (though to be fair the book offers options the 1.1 mil never could), and yes, TPM is not passive revenue, and yes, I put a ton of unpaid time up front into creating TPM, but when you look at it from a long-term cash perspective I think you could describe $2,800/mo as life-changing money. That number, by the way, is _not_ counting the secondary services business generated by this book.

I don’t say any of this to brag but simply to prove that at least in some cases, the revenue from digital product sales alone can be meaningful, even if you don’t look at the follow-on services revenue the digital product hopefully generates.

Digital products also can pay an authority dividend, which you can monetize down the road through higher fees. Being the person who "wrote the book on ___________" can relatively quickly establish you as an authority or an expert, and that can have very beneficial effects on your fees.

## Productized Services

What if you could lower the cost of selling your services and simultaneously lower the cost of delivering those services? All else being equal, you would increase profitability for those services. This is the core benefit of productized services, and the main reason you might consider them a route to greater profitability.

The simplest definition of a productized service is one where the price, scope, and delivery method are fixed and those vary little or not at all from client to client.

----

### _Sidebar_:

I’m aware that some readers will equate greater profitability with "getting one over on your clients". We’ve all certainly seen this happen in the world of products. 

You develop a bit of loyalty to some kind of product, you start to see quality degrade over time, you hear reports of production being shipped overseas, you put two and two together and notice that the cost reduction also reduced your customer experience, and you start to associate reduced cost with reduced quality. Or to use a very specific example, perhaps you remember the time when calling Dell for support with a computer put you in touch with a skilled support engineer who spoke English as their first language, and you also remember when more and more of those calls started being ineffectively handled by people with accents you have difficulty understanding, and so you come to the same conclusion that cost reduction also reduces quality. So I get it if you equate increasing profitability with taking away something that matters to your clients.

But with productized services, that’s not what’s happening at all. Instead, you are taking advantage of the natural benefits of delivering the same service over and over again to drive down the cost of delivering that service while producing better and better results for your clients. 

----

The cost-savings benefits of productized services are driven by the following factors:

1. __Marketing and Sales Benefits__
	2. You largely eliminate the work of creating a custom proposal.
	3. You gain greater insight into what makes a prospect a good fit and incrementally reduce the cost of dealing with bad-fit clients.
	4. (If you are a less experienced or confident marketer) You have "a thing" (the productized service) to market, so you no longer feel like you are "selling yourself". Instead you are selling something that feels substantive, and this increases your confidence in selling and marketing your services, which increases the effectiveness of your efforts.
5. __Fulfillment Benefits__
	5. You gain experience with the basics of delivering the service, which makes you better, faster, and more efficient. This may manifest as reduced errors and less re-work.
	6. You add processes and systems that simplify service delivery. Automation replaces some of the manual effort.
	7. You gain insight into what moves the needle for your clients’ business, and this helps you improve the core service offering.
	8. If staff are involved, you may find improvements there.
6. __Other Benefits__
	6. If all the above works as it should, you may increase the volume of clients you deal with in a given timeframe, which accelerates your accumulation of marketing proof you can use with future prospects.

That about covers the benefits to you. But wait, there’s more!

Smaller clients are often less sophisticated when it comes to buying services. Packaging your services as fixed price, fixed scope services can be a mutually beneficial way to deal with that lesser sophistication.

_They win_ because you help them get a job done, and you lower the risk they’ll mismanage the solution for that job. Think of it like selling them a fully-assembled smartphone rather than a box of components and assembly instructions. They might be able to build the smartphone on their own with the components, but the chances they’ll screw it up are pretty high.

_You win_ because, over time at least, your packaged standardized services become more profitable than custom services. 

We should touch on some caveats before moving on:

* Don’t expect massive profitability at first. You usually bootstrap that future profitability with an up-front sweat equity investment.
* Don’t try to shoehorn any old service into a productized service. Some stuff just doesn’t fit. One example comes to mind: MVPs as a productized service. On paper the idea seems good, but in reality this type of service is usually like falling into a bear trap hidden inside a tar pit of scope creep. Fixed price, fixed scope is good, but fixed price and wildly variable scope will kill profitability enough to turn you off from delivering the service (or worse).
* Favor productizing stuff you’ve actually already sold over untested services. The idea of productizing a service can be so appealing that you leap into your imaginarium to design an amazing productized service that turns out to be amazing on paper but amazingly unprofitable, amazingly difficult to actually sell, or amazingly boring or tedious to actually deliver. 

## Training

Let's talk about offering training services.

I have to confess that I have a soft spot for training, which renders me a bit over-enthusiastic at times in promoting it as a route to greater profitability. I worked as a Microsoft Certified Trainer from 1996 until about 2004 and in addition to allowing me to fully pay off my private school loans within 4 years of graduation, that experience gave me significant confidence in public speaking that has benefitted me[^2] throughout my career.

I understand completely that training is not a great fit for everyone. It can drain introverts quicker than a buggy smartphone OS drains the battery, and it subjects anyone's ego to more than a few potential scrapes and bruises.

That said, it can be an excellent route to increased profitability for several reasons. The final disclaimer I want to get out of the way here is that selling training to F500's and SMBs is pretty similar, so this route to greater profitability is not uniquely suited to SMBs only; it's relevant no matter what size business you focus on, even if you sell to individuals.

From a profitability perspective, training is very attractive because of how deterministic the pricing can be. Strictly productized services aside, training is priced more like a product than almost any other service I can think of except for services like massages, haircuts, etc. Pricing is usually set on a per student per day basis. For example, you might charge $300 per student per day, and collect $9,000 for a 3-day class with 10 students attending.

Compared to a software project that might just as easily take 9 months to complete as 3, that is _highly predictable_ revenue once the sale is made, and that predictability has a beneficial effect in planning your other revenue-generating activities. To be completely realistic, I have to acknowledge that there are occasional surprises, even with the predictable pricing of training. Classes may not fill, travel plans can be disrupted, and other minor "black swan" events can gum up the works. Even with those occasional glitches, I'd still characterize training revenue as more predictable than other types of services revenue.

From a cost perspective, training bears some resemblance to digital products. There is a non-trivial up-front cost in developing your curriculum and training materials. You can amortize this cost over multiple deliveries of the same training material. You can't do this kind of amortization with custom services because with custom services the upfront development cost and the delivery cost are combined. You’re always doing the upfront development, and you don’t get the same ability to amortize that cost over time.

Unlike digital products, training involves a non-trivial delivery cost (the time, expense, and opportunity cost of you actually delivering the training) and a maintenance cost (updating outdated content, improving content, etc.). Of course, both training and digital products must be marketed and sold. Like digital products, training can serve as an "emissary" for your more expensive productized or custom services.

## Group Events, or Leveraged Time

Training is one specific form of leveraged time. Instead of spending three 8-hour days with 10 people individually (30 days), you do it with the whole group at once (3 days). There are other ways to leverage time in a similar fashion to increase profitability:

1. Group mentoring or coaching: Kind of like training, but with less structure and more customization. Coaching is a "push" model while mentoring is a "pull" model.
2. Workshops: Kind of like training, but with less lecturing and more doing.
3. Seminars: Kind of like training, but with less doing and more lecturing.
4. Paid speaking: Kind of like seminars, but with less information and more motivation.

The shared characteristic of all of the above is that they are group events. They leverage your time in the same way that group training does, and they can make very attractive effective hourly rates available to you. Imagine selling a 2-day blockchain workshop or seminar priced at $300 per student per day. With 10 students, that works out to $6,000, or $375/hour (assuming 8 hours days and no other costs to you, and ignoring the upfront development cost for making the curriculum and marketing & selling the service). Bump the price to $500/student/day, and your effective hourly rate climbs to $625/hr.

## Advice-Only Retainers

Finally, we reach what may be the "crown jewel" of routes to higher profitability: advice-only retainers. They are pretty much what you'd think. To paraphrase Alan Weiss, in an advice-only retainer you sell "access to your smarts". Access to your thinking; not access to your doing.

I'm forced to refer to this type of service as "advice-only retainer" because of the widespread confusion around the meaning of the word "retainer". Does retainer mean pre-payment for access to services that are billed separately from the retainer fee, pre-payment for a block of time, access to your smarts, or something else? The term advice-only retainer eliminates this confusion.

Advice-only retainers can provide real value--even to smaller clients--in numerous ways:

* Offering guidance or reducing uncertainty during a risky change, which acts as a sort of insurance policy on the change.
* Offering ongoing guidance during a lengthy change, like integrating or learning to maintain a new system.
* Answering unpredictable questions that occur at unpredictable points in time.
* Acting as a "sounding board", an expert point of view, or an outside point of view on company decision-making.
* Providing a company leader with access to expertise they personally lack or do have in-house but don't trust.
* Acting as a "resident expert" on some particular issue for the client.
* Using your research or direct experience to help your client understand what competitors or the market in general is doing so your client makes better decisions.

It's possible we could reduce the incomplete list above down to 1 simple definition. _Advice-only retainers are valuable because you're helping your client make better decisions_.

The stories you might have heard about selling advice-only retainers at nosebleed prices (ex: $10k/mo for 24/7 access that actually only turns into a few 30-minute phone calls per month) are probably with F500 clients where the consultant has built up quite a bit of trust over time. That doesn't mean that SMBs won't pay what amount to very profitable prices for access to your smarts. The numbers may be smaller, but still profitable for you to provide.

Finally, the most obvious point in this entire paper. Advice-only retainers increase profitability because you are removing the least profitable part of the work--the implementation--from the equation and focusing on the more profitable part.

## Conclusion

Earlier I said I don’t have a dog in this fight. That’s probably not strictly true. I do _very much want you to increase the profitability of your business_. Specialization can do that, as can each one of the routes to greater profitability I’ve described above. So that’s my dog in this fight. :) 

I think many of these routes to profitability work _better_ or are _easier to get started with_ if you’re focused on SMBs. Again, if working with F500’s is where it’s at for your business, that’s great and you should go down that road. But don’t overlook how you can very profitably serve the "little guys" out there!

One of the benefits of adding these options is they have a diversifying effect on your revenue _while lowering the cost of acquiring new clients (CAC)_! The revenue diversification is probably obvious, but the lowering CAC is perhaps not.

I can’t count the number of times I’ve gone into my favorite vegetarian restaurant here in Sebastopol intending to get an appetizer-sized snack and walked out after buying a full meal. The same dynamic prevails when you provide multiple options at different price points for prospects. You can start providing value with something less expensive like a code review or a book while you build a trusting relationship that positions you well for a larger future project. Most of us are used to having to spend at least some time and energy to nurture new client relationships. It's quite the pleasant surprise when a stranger pays you money (ex: digital book sale) and then later becomes a client without you having to spend any time and energy in between.

Before I leave this topic, we should touch on the topic of SaaS. Given what I know from multiple second-hand sources, I want to encourage you to think long and hard before trying to increase profitability by building a SaaS. I’ve seen it sort of work at the expense of the host business, and I’ve seen it work well when the SaaSes are small products that are complementary to an existing platform (WP plugins, Shopify apps, Redmine modules, etc.), but I can’t think of any instance where launching a "big", "real" SaaS has been a synergistic long-term relationship with the host services business. Now I know it might work as a road out of the services world, but that’s different than augmenting the profitability of your services biz in a harmonious, complementary way, which all of the above do pretty well. I'm not anti-SaaS, but I am anti-distraction-to-your-core-focus, so make sure any SaaS project you spin up isn't that kind of distraction for you.
