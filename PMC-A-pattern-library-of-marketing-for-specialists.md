# A Pattern Library of Marketing for Specialists

The following are descriptions of marketing that I’ve seen work for specialists. They don’t work just once; they work repeatedly across multiple businesses. I’ll describe what these businesses are doing in a way that’s brief, and generally applicable to any other similarly-specialized firm.

## Horizontally specialized in cutting edge or complex platform (AWS)
### Core Elements

These show up more often than not:

* Weekly email list that serves by simplifying, aggregating, or cutting through noise. 
* Super-simple website for list signup and list archives, optional separate site for consulting & services

### Optional Elements

These can be added to the mix if desired:

* Weekly interview-format podcast
* Blog articles on the list signup site for added reader value and SEO benefit

### Examples

* Cory Quinn: @TODOlink, @TODOCPPLink
* Mike Julian: @TODOlink, @TODOCPPLink

## Horizontally specialized in a programming language
### Core Elements

Weekly tips/"learn the language" email list with published archives for SEO.

### Optional Elements

@TODO

### Examples


* Elemental Selenium: @TODOlink
* CPP interview(s) of trainers, Dave Ceddia, etc.


Other patterns that would be nice to document:

* Horizontally specialized in a commoditized tech
* Horizontally specialized in an evergreen business problem
* Horizontally specialized in a horizontal discipline (monitoring, TDD, etc.)
* Vertically specialized
* Multi-dimensional specialization
