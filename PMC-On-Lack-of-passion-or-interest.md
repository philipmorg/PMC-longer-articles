# On Lack of Passion/Interest

A while ago I got an email from a list subscriber who felt stuck with the specialization question. I'm going to completely anonymize his question so I can share my response here. It might be useful to others.

The question went like this:

> I've put a lot of work into looking for a niche I can focus on, but I can't get past that point. My clients don't know what pain points/problems they have, or they say generic stuff like "we need the phone to ring more".
> 
> The common advice is to choose a vertical based on your passion for something, but I get stuck there every time. My passion is for my family, but not any particular vertical.
> 
> What should I do?

Here's my reply:

Hi Bob,

I spent a fair bit of time trying to write up a longer form response to your question that I could later turn into an article. The answer to your question at first seemed to be something like "I bet you actually do have an interest you could parlay into a vertical specialization, you probably just haven't looked for it the right way yet" but in drafting the article I kept getting stuck every time I tried to support the idea of cultivating a totally new interest in order to make a specialization work.

Let me back up a step. When I interview people who have successfully specialized, several themes emerge:

1. You can specialize in a platform, programming language, or framework. This specialization approach does not require interest in any one vertical, but your fortunes are heavily influenced by the whims of the platform owner and the global talent market. Since many platforms trend towards commoditization in the supply of talent around the platform (ex: see market rates for iOS devs as a recent example), this is a specialization with a built-in lifecycle, and that lifecycle offers maybe 4 to 7 years of premium rates for early adopters, then it trends towards lower commodity rates.
2. You can successfully specialize in a vertical. This is a much more durable specialization, but you really do need to be interested in the vertical you choose. ("Interest" is the word I use instead of "passion" because the meaning of passion has been polluted a lot by startup founders trying to justify their expectation of insane levels of work output and commitment from developers.) Interest in a vertical looks like one or more of the following incomplete list of specific experiences:
	1. Empathy for the people in the vertical
	2. Enjoyment or appreciation for the work they do
	3. Excitement about the innovative aspects of the vertical
	4. Comfort being around the people in the vertical
	5. A desire to support the business goals of businesses in the vertical
	6. Fascination with how the vertical works
3. Finally, you can successfully specialize horizontally. The marketing requirements for doing this are usually pretty demanding unless you’re an incredibly early mover (ex: consultants who specialized in mobile circa 2009) or you just get lucky. A current example of a horizontal specialization would be a GDPR data compliance specialist, though the best horizontal specializations have an evergreen quality to them and I’m not sure GDPR compliance will be an evergreen skill that demands specialists for the next 10 or 20 years. Anyway… a horizontal specialization also requires interest, but the interest is focused on an evergreen-ish business problem rather than any single vertical.

I generally recommend vertical specialization as a safe, relatively easy starting point for a generalist who wants to specialize because the marketing requirements are much easier for them.

Where I keep getting stuck with respect to your question is this: thus far I have found no examples of people running solo or very small services business who have specialized in a vertical where they did not have previous experience of some kind. This makes the idea of inventing and then cultivating a brand new interest in order to specialize in a vertical seem a little farfetched. I’m not done with this interview-based research (the "moving the needle" episodes of http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com are what I’m talking about here), but thus far I’ve found no examples of people who cultivated a _brand spanking new_ interest in a vertical in order to specialize there.

Now to be fair, entrepreneurs--especially product business entrepreneurs--do this *all the time*. They identify an opportunity and then based on the potential of that opportunity they invest. Part of that investment might be cultivating real interest in a vertical; interest that they didn’t have before they identified the opportunity. They cultivate this interest in service of a larger goal, which is to understand their market and develop some kind of competitive advantage based on that insight into the market.

I've suggested that people in the services world can do the same. Entrepreneurial product people do it; why not entrepreneurial services providers? But again, thus far I’ve found no examples of this happening, and very few of my clients choose the option of specializing in a vertical where they have no previous experience. Many more of my clients choose what I call the "find your head start" option, which simply means choosing to specialize in an area where you do have some previous experience. This isn’t always work-related experience. I recently interviewed someone who helps competitive motorsports designers optimize airflow to make their cars go faster, and I was not surprised to learn that he grew up around race cars ([CPP 106: Robin Knowles on giving companies a competitive advantage by optimizing airflow | The Consulting Pipeline Podcast](http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com/106)). His expertise in CFD came later than his exposure to race cars, but when he decided to specialize, he chose an area that was familiar to him where his CFD skills have clear value. If he’d grown up around the hospitality or food service industry, I’m not sure what value his CFD expertise would have in those verticals, and so I’m not sure he would have specialized vertically at all.

Specializing in a vertical where you have no prior experience is also the most risky approach to specialization. That’s another reason why so few of my clients have chosen this approach. Most of the self-employed devs that I’ve run a risk profile for can tolerate some risk (you have to be able to for self-employment to be viable at all over the long term), but they’re not the typical hard-driving, risk-seeking entrepreneurial type. Some are, but most aren’t.

There are people who would like to specialize in a way that is durable over the long term, but they fit into one of the following situations:

1. Very little previous experience. Maybe they’re young and fresh out of school, or maybe they just got into self-employment after having a job or series of jobs in the same vertical, and they really dislike that vertical.
2. A pretty good amount of previous experience in several different verticals, but none of it is interesting enough for them to want to specialize vertically. Or worse, most or all of that experience is in verticals the person dislikes.

I believe one of these is your situation. These are the situations where I want to say, "but you *can* cultivate your interest in some area where you have no previous experience, specialize there, and get the benefits of specialization!" Again, see my previous comments about the risk and the general unpopularity of this approach. In other words, it feels like impractical, unhelpful advice for most people, unless they are some kind of risk-tolerant entrepreneurial diamond in the rough.

And that’s why I say I’m a bit stuck on this. If you really truly don’t have any interest in a vertical where you have some previous experience, then your specialization options are all high-risk ones. You could take the risky option of trying to cultivate a new interest, or you could fall back on one of these approaches:

* Specialize horizontally in a platform, and--unless you get lucky--suffer the inevitable ups and downs of this approach. If you're relatively young, you won't mind this as much as us olds. But trust me, it eventually does get tiring and then you'll tend to seek something more durable and stable.
* Remain a generalist and try to figure out some other way to address the marketing inefficiencies and value limitations that are inherent in the generalist market position.

I suppose a third option would be to pick a vertical where you _do_ have previous experience and try to ignore your low interest in that vertical, knowing that your specialization in that vertical is purely a bootstrapping/traction approach and as soon as it is helping you gain traction you’ll start to broaden your focus. In other words, specialize temporarily to get un-stuck, then re-generalize later. In theory this can work (in reality it happens a fair bit as the specialist's success attracts opportunity from outside the area of specialization and they naturally relax their initial tight focus to pursue interesting opportunities outside the focus), but I’m hesitant to recommend it because at least for me, misalignments between my heart and my head have never lasted long, and you’d need to be able to act and think like a specialist for 2 years or so for this to be even worth trying at all. In other words, the specialization would be a purely mercenary move, and you'd need to have that mercenary personality orientation for this to work.

That's a lot of bad news for someone who wants to specialize but really truly has no interest in any particular market vertical or evergreen business problem. The *good* news in all of this is if there is even one vertical or evergreen business problem where you do have a head start and a spark of interest that you could nurture into a small flame, then (assuming the market size and a few other factors check out), you have a good option for specializing. I haven't done a great job of saying what interest actually is (and I wonder if the best possible definition is Justice Potter Stewart's "I know it when I see it" definition) but see my list above for my best effort so far. But if you really, truly don’t have that combination of a head start and interest converging on a single vertical or business problem, then I can’t recommend specialization unless you have a very entrepreneurial orientation, and if you have that then you probably don’t need my help anyway. :)

Again, my research into this continues, and I’ve got a _lot_ more people to speak to. So consider this an interim answer that may be updated if, as "The Dude" would say, some new shit comes to light. :)

Hope this was helpful,
-P

TL;DR: There are 5 ways to specialize. 1 of them kind of sucks as a long-term strategy, but the other 4 ways require from you some kind of interest in a vertical or business problem. If you lack this interest now but have a high risk tolerance or "mercenary" orientation you can cultivate the interest as a tool to make the specialization work, but people with these orientations tend towards product-based entrepreneurial ventures because of the potentially greater upside of these approaches. In other words, the risk-seeker/mercenary type tends to embody the inventor or entrepreneur archetype rather than the craftsman or expert archetype. Thus if you really truly lack interest in a vertical or business problem, then specialization is probably not your best career development option.

Troubleshooting this idea

There are people who can cultivate an interest on purpose because it serves some purpose of theirs. And… there are those that probably can’t. I don’t know what the distribution looks like between those two poles. I imagine it mirrors whatever the distribution of entrepreneurial qualities or entrepreneurial success looks like. This seems to suggest a "you’ve got it or you don’t" kind of division.

This might look like:
* Highly entrepreneurial: cultivate interest if it helps you seize a new opportunity
* Not highly entrepreneurial:
	* Look for existing interests
	* If not, just specialize in some other way and make the best of it

Dear self-employed software develop who has no passion other than coding,

I hear from others just like you from time to time, and I feel that I owe you a candid, objective response to a question that I get asked fairly often. It usually goes just like this:

> I am sold on the idea of specializing, but I'm really **stuck** because I'm not passionate about any vertical at all. My only real passion is [code | my family | other thing that seems to have no relationship with business].

Regarding passion, there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is if you're passionate about code (or a specific language, framework, or platform), you can build a market position around that.

The bad news is that market position comes with a self-destruct timer attached to it, already well on its way towards exploding by the time you've built your business around it. This market position, by the way, is known as platform specialization.

## Platform Specialization: Problematic at Best

Platform specialization is a problematic approach to specialization because it forces a business model and value proposition that may as well come with a self-destruct timer already ticking by the time you enter the market as a specialist in iOS, Rails, Node, blockchain, Salesforce, AWS, or any other language, framework, operating system, or platform you can think of. It's not that the platform suddenly becomes completely irrelevant and the markey value of your skills plunges to $0. That's not what happens.

Here's what does happen instead. In the first three years or so of the platform's life--if it really takes off the way Rails, iOS, Node, React, and Angular have--demand for skills far exceeds supply. This is like a shot of amphetamines for your business. Hourly rates climb into specialized attorney territory, and business development is often no more difficult than updating your LinkedIn profile or sending out a few exploratory emails and watching as eager prospects to show up and ask how soon you can start.

In years four and onward this trend gradually slows down, stalls, and then reverses as the market for platform-specific skills starts to trend towards commoditization. In a commoditized market, the supply of competent people/businesses who possess the needed skill exceeds the demand for that skill, and buyers have lots of options. Lower price options, less demanding options, options that will do all kind of crazy stuff (like pitching for free) to get the project. Most platforms become fully commoditized in about seven years, though it can happen faster or slower or never, depending on factors that are too oblique to get into here.

Let me be clear here about two things: you *can* build a solid services business around commoditized skills, and you *can* differentiate that business from competition. I'd never want to build that kind of business myself, and most people who hire me to help them specialize share the same distaste for being regarded as a commodity.  But you can do it, and I'm not saying otherwise--just know what you're getting into and let the decision be a conscious choice, not a default non-choice. Second, the reason most developers don't want to be regarded is a commodity is because *they've tasted what it's like to have economically valuable expertise*. During the first three to four years of a platform's popularity, you get a taste of what it's like to have economically valuable expertise, and once you get a taste of that you do **not** want to see that market position erode out from underneath you.

Yet, that's precisely what happens when your market position is based on your skill with a specific technology platform. The value of that skill erodes when the market becomes commoditized and if you want to continue to specialize in a platform, pretty much all you can do is work harder to find good clients, work more hours, or jump ship to the next up-and-coming platform. In other words, all you can do is accept the "terms of service" that commoditization forces on you.

That's why I dislike platform specialization as a business model/value proposition for solo self-employed developers and small shops. Yes, we all need to continually improve and periodically reinvent ourselves and our businesses in order to stay relevant in the fast-changing world of technology. You can't avoid learning, but I think doing a dramatic expertise re-tooling every 4 to 7 years is too much cost on a too-frequent basis.[^2] If there was a way to develop expertise assets with a longer shelf life, shouldn't we at least investigate those options?

I'm not sure I've convinced you at this point that specializing in a platform is problematic, but I have voiced my main objections to platform specialization as a business model/value proposition. In other words, I've said the way of specializing that most naturally aligns with your passion is a problematic way of specializing. Moving right along...

## Those Other 4 Specialization Approaches

There are 4 other ways of specializing[^3]. They all can cultivate more durable, valuable market positions than platform specialization, but they really do require something like "passion" in order to work. I prefer the word "interest" instead because the word passion has such a tortured meaning. I blame HR departments, technology startup founders, and self-help gurus. I think they've given us an unrealistic picture of passion that is intentionally self-serving to their goals, not ours.

The first thing I want to say here is that you might be wrong about your self-assessed lack of interest in something outside  [code | my family | other thing that seems to have no relationship with business]. You might just be flat wrong about that, and you might be wrong because you've bought into a distorted understanding of what interest really is. This happens very easily if your primary picture of the world comes from online media and you have few or no relationships with people who have built a business based on economically valuable expertise. In other words, this happens very easily if you're the wrong kind of information bubble. If every childhood teacher and role model taught you that being in love felt like an intense, throbbing pain in your left foot, then you'd quickly be forgiven for not knowing if you're actually in love with another person.

### What is Interest, Really?

What is this thing that I think is vital to all the effective forms of specialization?

@TODO: pick up here


	* Talk about what interest is *really* like.
		* @TODO
		* Curiosity + determination
		* Looking past the surface, patience
		* Applied curiosity
		* 
	* Talk about the lover-fighter spectrum, and how a mercenary approach can work but is not necessary.

## Interest and Your Value Proposition
I suppose the ultimate business, from a profitability perspective, would be based on a product you could invent in a day and sell with extremely high profitability for the rest of time. In this case, we'd refer to the product as an evergreen seller.

This idea of evergreen business assets is very important, and I think not enough of us consider it when making strategy-level decisions about our business. I understand why: most of us run businesses that were forged in the fires of necessity. We suddenly lost a job and decided to go freelance, for example. In that situation, it's understandable that long-term strategy is not top of mind.

But eventually, if you want to evolve the business you hastily built into a durable, profitable services business, you have to think about these strategy questions. And a very important one of them is the following:

> What are the primary assets your business uses to create value for your clients? How unique are those assets?

OK, I snuck two questions in there, but they're really two sides of the same coin. An asset that's not very unique is easily offered by your competition, so uniqueness is a core property of the most valuable business assets, at least in an expertise-driven services business.

Here's my main argument: In the first 3 to 5 years of a services business, interest in the market you serve is a more important asset than your purely technical skill. As the business matures, the expertise you develop based on your initial interest becomes the business's most valuable asset.

Why do I believe this? It's because interest helps you build the following evergreen business assets, and it contributes far more to their development than purely technical skill does:

	* A critical mass of relationships in a space, often vertically-defined.
	* Economically valuable expertise that outlasts the popularity of any single platform.
	* Empathy, which is perhaps the number one entreprenurial-business-bootstrapping asset.
	* An emotional resilience to help you ride out the tough times.
	* An ability to turn experience into expertise and then into what Alan Weiss calls "marketing gravity".

So at this point I'm saying two things that might seem contradictory. First, I'm saying that interest in something outside your technical skillset is critical to building a durable, profitable services business. Second, I'm saying that you might be wrong about lacking that kind of interest. Or at least, you might not know what that kind of interest looks like very early on, when it looks more like an embryo than the full-grown animal it can become with time and nurture.

## Discovering Interest
How might you find out whether you have some kind of interest that can be nurtured into an effective specialization and thereby help you build a powerful market position? Let's get some preliminary constraints out of the way.

First, be realistic about your relationship to risk. Interest can't overcome a long sales cycle combined with a short runway, so don't expect it to. If a nascent interest in something points you to something too risky, find greener pastures. For example, you might be interested in the idea of environmental sustainability. You will find others who share that interest in segments of several verticals, certainly including agriculture and energy production. Additional research might reveal that those verticals look great except they have 9 to 18-month long sales cycles, and your meager savings just can't sustain that kind of business development runway.  In this case, your interest is unlikely to be a more powerful factor than the physics of the sales cycle, so find greener pastures. Use a realistic understanding of your risk profile to scope how far afield of your previous experience you might stray in pursuing an your interest.

Second, be realistic about what you will and won't need to care about with your clients. The expertise you develop as a specialist is primarily about how you apply technology in order to move the needle for your clients. It's *not* about being able to step in and run the business if the CEO gets run over by a bus. So as you think about where your interest might lead you, keep in mind that you don't need to completely ditch your identity as a technologist.

Third, understand the idea of segmenting a market. No vertical is fully homogeneous in terms of being exciting or boring or anything like that. Exciting industries have boring segments, and boring industries have exciting segments. Day 1 as a specialist does not usually give you the ability to cherry-pick clients, but year 2 or 3 probably will, so have faith that your interest will lead you somewhere good, even if it's focused initially on what seems like boring work. By the way, if the thought of investing 2 to 3 years of sacrifice into your business doesn't seem worth it in order to yield 10 or more years of what you want, then you're not cut out for this. You're definitely not cut out for the discipline of specialization, and you might not be cut out for self-employment. I just can't say it any other way while respecting my promise to be candid and objective. If 2 or 3 years of short-term sacrifice for a long-term benefit won't work for you, find a job with a boss who will let you do what you want in the short term.

@TODO: elaborate on this: Fourth, understand the power of being an insider. Again, not an insider in the board room, but an insider in _some_ way. Possibilities include:
	* Shared values
	* Shared vocabulary
	* Shared vision
	* Shared background

@TODO: Try to give some case study style examples of interest leading to a good specialization.

## Actually Finding That Spark of Interest
At this point I hope that I've more or less performed an exorcism on any distorted or unhelpful ideas about what interest is. That still leaves the question, *how do I identify **my** interest, Philip?*

My hope is that removing any misapprehensions of what interest is is all it took to connect you with an answer to that question. But if things don't work out that way for you, the following may help. In my work with clients, these approaches have led some people to discovering interests they didn't know they had.

### NAICS Inventory
@TODO

### @TODO: one or two other methods

* By way of summary, yes, I'm trying to make sure that if specialization is an option for you we don't overlook any possible forms of interest that might get you there. I suspect that a lot of you, when you say you're not passionate about anything outside of code, are thinking too narrowly or setting the bar for interest/passion too high.
* But also I'm trying to prepare you for the "third wave"[^4], which will have strong demand for folks who can bridge the worlds of technology and some specific domain of business or government.
* I'm also trying to help you decide if you're really cut out for this. Sure, going horizontal on a platform can be a great short-term strategy. But if you want to combine self-employment with a focus on building long-term assets that free you from a 7-yearly learning cycle and increase your profitability over time, I can't really see any other way to do it other than identifying an interest and using that as a lever or platform by which to cultivate evergreen business assets.

[^2]: I am aware that when learning a new language, framework, or platform you do carry forward generally-applicable learning from before. So the second learning curve is usually less intense than the first, and so on. I know that, and it does not negate my main point, which is that _any_ skill re-tooling is potentially inefficient, or at least needs to be considered as a cost of doing business. It's interesting to note that professions like medicine, law, and other licensed professions have barriers to entry which serve--perhaps unintentionally--to slow down the pace of change in those professions relative to the un-licensed professions that we practice.

[^3]: The 5 specialization approaches are as follows:

1. Specialize in applying technology/software to a specific __market vertical__
2. Specialize in applying technology/software to a specific __audience of businesses__ (an audience is a group that are brought together by a shared need, situation, or interest)
3. Specialize in a specific __technology platform__ (language, framework, operating system, or platform)
4. Specialize in a specific __evergreen business problem__ (ex: hiring developers, open source, using e-commerce to compete compete with Amazon, etc.)
5. Specialize in a **unique way of delivering your services or creating value for clients**. I call this "Blue Ocean" specialization for reasons that are insignificant here.

## Parking Lot

You may indeed be stuck, but before we declare specialization a non-starter for you, let's do three things. First, let’s back up and look at the big picture around specialization . It'll create context and allow you to think more productively about this. Then let’s correct any misapprehensions you may have regarding passion. The startup press have done a lot to distort this idea, and they may have left you with an unhelpful notion of what passion actually is. Finally, let’s explore how you might identify a passion or two you didn’t know was there. 

## 5 Specialization Approaches


## The Specialization Approach That's Natural to You
I'm certain that by now you've identified the specialization approach that is naturally appealing to you. If you're anything like most freelance developers, it's #3: platform specialization. [^1]

This is a problematic approach to specialization because it forces a business model and value proposition that may as well come with a self-destruct timer attached to it and already ticking by the time you enter the market as a specialist in Rails, Node, blockchain, Salesforce, AWS, or any other language, framework, operating system, or platform you can think of. It's not that the platform suddenly becomes completely irrelevant and the value of your skills plunges to $0. That's not what happens.

Here's what does happen instead. In the first three years or so of the platform's life--if it really takes off the way Rails, iOS, Node, React, and Angular have--demand for skills far exceeds supply. This is like a shot of amphetamines for your business. Hourly rates climb into specialized attorney territory, and business development is no more difficult than updating your LinkedIn profile or sending out a few exploratory emails and waiting for eager prospects to show up and ask how soon you can start.

In a commoditized market, the supply of competent people/businesses who possess the needed skill exceeds the demand for that skill, and buyers have lots of options. Lower price options, less demanding options, options that will do all kind of crazy stuff to get the project. Most platforms become fully commoditized in about seven years, though it can happen faster or slower or never, depending on factors that are too oblique to get into here.

Let me be clear here about two things: you *can* build a solid services business around commoditized skills, and you can differentiate that business from competition. I'd never want to build that kind of business myself, and most people who hire me to help them specialize share the same distaste for being regarded as a commodity.  But you can do it, and I'm not saying otherwise--just know what you're getting into and let the decision be a conscious choice, not a default non-choice.

Yet, that's precisely what happens when your market position is based on your skill with a specific technology platform. The value of that skill erodes when the market becomes commoditized and if you want to continue to specialize in a platform, pretty much all you can do is work harder to find good clients, work more hours, or jump ship to the next up-and-coming platform.

That's why I dislike platform specialization as a business model/value proposition for solo self-employed developers and small shops. Yes, we all need to continually improve and periodically reinvent ourselves and our businesses in order to stay relevant in the fast-changing world of technology. You can't avoid learning, but I think doing a dramatic expertise re-tooling every 4 to 7 years is too much cost on a too-frequent basis.[^2] If there was a way to develop expertise assets with a longer shelf life, shouldn't we at least investigate them?

I'm not sure I've convinced you at this point that specializing in a platform is problematic, but I have voiced my main objections to platform specialization as a business model/value proposition. In other words, I've said the way of specializing that most naturally aligns with your passion is a problematic way of specializing. Moving right along...

 1 of them is naturally appealing to you (platform), but that's a self-destructing value proposition, just like those self-destructing tapes from that old TV show. It's OK as a way to get started, and it works fine as a FTE, but it's problematic as a business model.
		* Caveats: sure, you can build a biz on a commodity platform, but you'll tend to be at a disadvantage relative to your larger competition with a deeper bench. This may, however, be a good fit for your aspirations, which might be a modest high 5-figure or very low 6-figure business, or a larger business with more stress (employees) and lower margins. It's important to be realistic about this stuff! And I don't want to come across as a jerk either as I frame this as a modest aspiration. It is modest for me and lots of the folks I work with, but it might be great for you.
	* The value prop of tech-specific expertise is self-destructing because tech skill is not an evergreen business asset/competitive advantage, it is a temporary advantage in a fast-moving supply-demand situation that usually trends towards commoditization. Medicine, law, and other licensed professions have barriers to entry to keep the supply-demand situation more stable, but we in tech don't have that working for us.
