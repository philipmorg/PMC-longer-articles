If you want KPI's for your marketing, count 1) people influenced by your thinking instead of site visits, 2) unsolicited forwards of your published thinking instead of social media followers, and 3) questions about your point of view instead of conversions. Google Analytics won't help here. Neither will Mixpanel. Only a real relationship with your audience will.

Am I proposing KPIs that can't be measured by a software tool? Yes. Yes, I am.

OK, you _could_ put together a spreadsheet that you manually update and you would be using a software tool as part of measuring these KPIs. But.. that's not really the point.

The point is you _feel_ these KPIs much more than you can quantify them objectively. And for a business that's fundamentally a relationship business, that's 100% appropriate.
