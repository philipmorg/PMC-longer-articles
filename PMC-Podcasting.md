Let's talk about podcasting! :)

TBH, I'm not sure exactly what I'll have to add here. Others have already [written great stuff](https://www.davidcbaker.com/launch-your-career-as-a-podcast-guest) about podcasting. Liston and I have riffed about it in... a podcast episode. Several, actually: [this](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/how-to-create-a-podcast), [this](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/podcast-listeners), and [this](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/podcast-guest-tips).

Nevertheless, I figured it's worth trying to write something relatively complete, to consolidate information that's previously leaked out of my brain in a scattered way and have something useful to send folks when I get the occasional question about starting and running a podcast.

Let's get the absolutely least important part out of the way first: equipment.

## Equipment

Sound quality matters, but only insofar as it potentially interferes with other more important things, the chief of which is _being interesting_. In other words, your goal is to avoid bad sound. Really good sound is just gravy. It's not table stakes, it's a nice bonus [1].

I've tried lots of things myself. In college, I read every back issue of Mix magazine, did live sound for a band, and interned in a recording studio in Nashville. So I'm at least un-ignorant when it comes to this the topic of microphones and studio gear. My advice is to get real by repeating to yourself 10 times "great sound quality won't fix boring content", and then put yourself in one of these three buckets:

1. I'm on a budget, this podcast thing is an experiment anyway, and so I can go cheap with the gear until I figure out if the experiment works.
2. I don't mind spending up to $500 on this experiment, but I'm still not sure the experiment is going to work so I want to limit my downside to $500 if it doesn't.
3. I just love gear and cables and shiny things and I want the best equipment, even if the podcast itself doesn't go anywhere. I generally buy the best because I like using the best stuff.

Again, be real about things when you self-bucket into one of the above. Then, choose equipment accordingly:

### Bucket 1

Buy a Sennheiser PC7. If you can't stand the idea of hearing things only in one ear and your ears don't stick out a lot from your skull, get a Sennheiser PC8, which has earphones on both sides of your head. My ears do stick out from my skull a fair bit, and this causes the PC8 to fit badly while the PC7 basically fits fine.

The microphone is the same in both, and it's the best sound quality for a low price Liston or I have found. You will have to futz with the position of the mic boom to avoid excessive plosives or breathing noises, but if you park the mic element a half inch or so _below_ your cake hole, you'll probably sound great.

Here's a fun test. I'm going to link you to two episodes of Offline, the podcast Liston and I do together. In one, you'll hear me using the Sennheiser PC7, and in the other, you'll hear me using a microphone that is almost 10 times more expensive. Note that for our podcast, we each record our end locally, which removes lossy compression from the sound quality equation here. Guess which one was recorded with which microphone. Write me if you want the answer:

1. [offlinepodcast.rocks/4c79056c](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/4c79056c)
2. [offlinepodcast.rocks/03b36f12](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/03b36f12)

The PC7 travels well, if that's a concern for you, and it also makes you sound pretty good on video calls. It keeps your desk generally free from gear clutter, it's fairly rugged (but not indestructible; nothing is), and it's cheap.

### Bucket 2

Get an Audio Technica ATR-2100 and--optionally--a DBX 286s. The 286s really elevates the sound of the ATR-2100 to near-pro levels of sound quality.

If you get the 286s, you'll have to also get something that converts an analog audio signal to a digital signal, and there are multiple choices for that. The Behringer UCA202 is a good option. And then you'll need cables and adapters, and you're on your own there. As you navigate this, remember, _you chose this path_. I tried to sell you on the PC7, so don't ask me which RCA to quarter inch TRS mono to stereo to whosawhatsit cable you need for this more elaborate setup. :)

If you take this path, you'll also need a mic stand or boom, and you may also want a shock mount. Again, there are multiple choices out there that can work, and a bit of research or experimentation will lead you the right way.

What's nice about this setup is:

- The ATR-2100 mic punches well above its price point, both used alone and used with the 286s.
- For travel, unless you do a lot of podcasting on the road, you can just throw the ATR-2100 and a USB cable (it uses the less common USB plug on the mic end of the cable) in your bag and have a good travel podcasting setup (including your normal computer/recording setup, of course). You need to be gentle in holding the mic with your hand otherwise you'll get handling noise, but aside from that it's a nice "goldilocks" solution for travel.
- When you add the 286s preamplifier to the setup, it significantly elevates the sound quality. It adds complexity and expense, but I think most people would be very hard-pressed to hear a meaningful difference between a 286s and ATR-2100 compared to a dramatically more expensive rig. Here's my wife using the ATR-2100 + 286s combination: [www.porcelanosa-usa.com/healthcare-id-podcast/](https://www.porcelanosa-usa.com/healthcare-id-podcast/)

### Bucket 3

Go wild. Get the Sure Sm7b and squeak by with a 286s or get a fancy preamp. Or get an Electro Voice RE20, the other radio studio standard. Or be weird like me and get an RE16 (which I call the "Elvis mic" because Elvis used the very similar RE15 on stage during his Vegas years). Or follow Marco Armet's advice and get a Shure Beta 87a. Or follow David Baker's advice from the article I linked you to at the top of this article and get a Neumann mic.

Get an exotic preamp like the Sound Devices. Or get one of the Universal Audio preamps with DSP in it. Or get some funky cool old preamp with transformers in it on eBay from a radio studio that's going digital. Add in compression and EQ and de-essing and a noise gate.

Get the $300 badass K&M boom stand for your desk. Get a microphone flag so you look especially pretentious. Get a dorky pic like this made:

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_0039-email.jpeg)

Stick sound-absorbing foam on the walls. Again, just go wild at this level. It'll be fun for you, if you fit into this bucket!

## Software

This has been written about ad nauseum, so I'll keep it simple, knowing that most of y'all are more technical than I am.

### Solo podcasts

Easy. Use Audacity, Audio Hijack, or Ferrite, depending on what OS you're on and how much or how little money you want to spend. Everything on this list is pretty well tested, good, high-value software.

### Interview podcasts

Every option here sucks in its own special, unique way, so set your expectations accordingly.

I recently had an opportunity to interview one of the top WebRTC developers in the world. It was for client work, but I snuck in a personal question: "What's the best app for high quality, full duplex, realtime audio for podcast interviews?"

He literally shrugged his shoulders. :( (Lovely guy, not criticizing him, it's just a reinforcement of the generally disappointing tools landscape here.)

You need a way to talk with your guest, and you need a way to record the conversation. Here are some ways to talk:

- Skype. I'm biting my tongue so hard here it bleeds. Skype is ubiquitous but comprised. If you're podcasting with a regular co-host, probably consider using Skype or Zoom with a double-ended recording setup. Google it if that term is unfamiliar.
- Zoom. Less compromised IMO than Skype, and if your guest has pro equipment, it's possible to get pretty good audio quality w/Zoom. Ex: [consultingpipelinepodcast.com/090](http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com/090) (David Baker and I recorded this podcast episode using Zoom and I think he sounds quite good in it.) Liston and I use Zoom for Offline, though we record double-ended, unlike the episode of CPP I just linked you to where my audio was recorded locally but David's was transferred through Zoom before being recorded on my end. Zoom also makes it easy to have a backup recording by using Zoom's cloud recording feature.
- Zencastr. Biting my tongue again. I had several crappy experiences with Zencastr and swore it off. My podcaster colleagues have generally had better experiences with it, so YMMV. It's got a great promise in that it records double-ended and requires little to no setup, since it's presumably using WebRTC via a browser window.
- Ringr. Has potential, but was late to the party with the ability to record more than 2 people in a conversation. They've added this capability, so maybe it's a good option now.
- ipDTL. WTF what were they smoking when they creating the UI for this? Seems powerful and pro, but super intimidating to use.
- Others like Anchor, et al. No idea.

The tools you might use to _record_ a podcast interview where you're using Skype--which doesn't have a built in recording function--might include Audio Hijack, Skype Call Recorder, or other stuff I haven't tried.

I like Audio Hijack (sorry this is so Mac-centric, y'all) better than Skype Call Recorder because the Skype team at Microsoft seems to be compensated partially or entirely based on how often they can break the janky integration between Skype and Skype Call Recorder. Oh, and how often they can move things around in the UI of Skype for no reason at all. They appear to also be compensated based on that as well. Stack ranking FTW!!

Again, I want to be crystal clear here. I'm getting the inconsequential stuff out the way first. The consequential stuff is _what you say_ on the podcast. The inconsequential stuff is _what you record yourself with_.

This is enough for today.

So what's the rest of this series going to look like?

Well...

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Photo-2019-04-25-08-59.GIF)

Have a superior weekend,
-P

PS: Kidding with the Napoleon Dynamite thing. I'm glad I've got the weekend to think about the rest of this, because the actually important stuff is--again--not the equipment but _being interesting_ or _being valuable_. Here's what I actually plan to touch on in the rest of this series:

- Interviewing guests
- Show design/topic selection
- Seasons or ongoing or miniseries
- Audience growth
- Publication questions: frequency, scheduling, etc.

---- 

1: Good sound is a bonus _if you are publishing a podcast that is basically business-focused or primarily informational or mainly for generating leads_. If your podcast is some form of entertainment or "media", then you may indeed need better sound or production quality to achieve your goals.


# [PMC] Series: Podcasting, pt2

(Readin' time: 16 minutes and 29 scintillating seconds)

OK! We've talked about equipment. We'll move onto more consequential things now, after I touch on a few questions from the last email.

One Q I got more than once was, "What! Why no love for the Blue Yeti mic?"

It's not a bad mic at all. I've never used one, but I'm pretty sure the Yeti is what Aaron Mahnke uses for "Lore", so you can't argue the mic is ill-suited to podcasting!

I just don't recommend it as a blanket recommendation because it--like almost all large diaphragm condenser microphones--is more demanding. It demands better mic technique, and it's more able to pick up room noise in the form of background noise, fan noise, street noise, and echo.

I don't know how Jonathan Stark sounds so great with his large diaphragm mic (an MXL-branded mic, IIRC), but I suspect it has to do with his secret history as a performing musician and the good mic technique that cultivated. I'm pretty sure with the same mic, I'd sound like a mouthbreathing, lipsmacking mess.

Second Q: "What about other software for recording, like Screenflow or Quicktime?"

Oh for sure, there are lots of other tools you could use and things would turn out great. I know Paul Jarvis used Quicktime for many of his podcasts, and others use Screenflow. And I'm surely leaving out many many other possible software tools. So yeah, my previous list was not exhaustive at all.

My main recommendation with respect to software tools and podcasting is: if you use the tool for live interviews, _have a backup_. The more famous your guest, the more you're going to want to have a tested, ready backup in case your primary tool decides to take a dirt nap during or right before an important interview.

And even with a good backup tool/workflow in place, things as simple as a minor version update to your primary tool can cause unexpected problems, especially if the tool has to integrate with Skype or is fussy about integrating with external audio hardware. So the remedy here is to _not_ assume that something that was working perfectly the last time you used it will work perfectly this time. Leave some extra time before those important interviews for troubleshooting stuff that has mysteriously stopped working.

Do I sound like someone who has been through the wringer with this stuff? I guess that last two paragraphs were therapy for me. Onward!

Lets talk about show format and topic selection today.

Talk about a consequential decision!

Well, that's _one_ way to look at it. You can think about your choice of topic and show format as choices that shall be carved in stone for all time, but this choice can also be about as permanent as chalk on a chalkboard, if you want. It's not a face tattoo, after all!

## What makes a topic interesting

Underneath most questions about show format and topic are three underlying questions:

1. _What_ is your podcast for?
2. _Who_ is your podcast for?
3. _How hard_ are you willing to work to make your podcast interesting?

You need to answer questions 1 and 2 before you answer question 3, because questions 1 & 2 set the boundaries within which you need to answer question 3.

### What can a podcast do?

If we try to classify the world of possibilities for a podcast, we get the following groupings, which are ordered based on why I suspect _you_ might want to invest in creating a podcast, and--critically--are not mutually exclusive:

1. Generate leads
2. Serve an audience with a free gift of knowledge
3. Give you a structured space within which to explore and refine your thinking in public
4. Promote a specific service offering in a way more focused on that specific offering than #1 on this list would be
5. Build your professional network
6. Serve as part of a "multichannel" content marketing approach (ex: you write blog posts, then you record yourself reading them and publish those as a podcast, or you talk about them with a friend and publish those conversations as a podcast)
7. Get better at public speaking
8. Meet and talk to interesting people who you invite to guest on your podcast
9. Build fame/authority (I can't help but immediately mention that this is a terrible goal because fame or authority are really second-order consequences of doing something _else_ well, and trying to "do fame/authority-building well" is like trying to push a rope. The way you actually build fame/authority is by being excellent or consistent or generous in doing something that others need or value and want to tell others about.)
10. Monetize purely through sponsorships

There are probably more categories we could create here, but I'll stop at 10. You can see that there are lots of reasons you might invest the time, effort, and money it takes to create a podcast. [1]

I think this variety of reasons-why partially explains the current popularity of podcasting. It's an incredibly flexible medium which allows creators to try lots of fun things, and the wider-than-video reach of audio is an additional amplifying factor.

Most business podcasts will combine several of the 10 reasons on my list. I'll pull a few examples from my own stable of podcasts and a few from the heavy rotation list of my podcast player:

- [consultingpipelinepodcast.com](http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com): Lead generation + Free gift of knowledge + Enjoy talking to interesting people
- [theexpertiseincubator.simplecast.fm/](https://theexpertiseincubator.simplecast.fm/): Free gift of knowledge + Promote specific service offering
- [offlinepodcast.rocks](http://offlinepodcast.rocks):  Free gift of knowledge + Explore and refine thinking + Get to talk to a friend regularly (this wasn't on the list above :) )
- [2bobs.com](https://2bobs.com): Multichannel amplification of written content + Free gift of knowledge + Generate leads
- [www.thebusinessofauthority.com](https://www.thebusinessofauthority.com): Free gift of knowledge + Generate leads + Explore and refine thinking
- [www.merlinmann.com/roderick/](https://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/): Kidding; not a business podcast. :) But one of the reasons Merlin and John have mentioned for doing this podcast is that they're friends who get an excuse to regularly talk to each other. And they monetize it through sponsorships.
- [exponent.fm](https://exponent.fm): Free gift of knowledge + Explore and refine thinking + Generate leads
- [www.akimbo.me](https://www.akimbo.me): Free gift of knowledge + Generate leads + Monetize through sponsorships

As you survey the podcast landscape, you'll see a variety of reason-why motivations, but I think you'll almost always see multiple reasons-why bundled in the same podcast. And this can create a tension, especially if you see the "generate leads" and "free gift of knowledge" reasons-why coexisting in the same podcast.

The tension, I think, is pretty easily resolved. In escalating order of how artful you need to do to pull it off:

1. Make the podcast itself the most generous, well-executed, helpful free gift of knowledge you can possibly make it. Then stick your commercial message talking about your services or how someone can become a lead at the very end of each episode. For an example, listen to any episode of Akimbo and mentally edit out the sponsor reads (which will just leave you with Seth's commercial messsage for his offerings), and you'll get the idea.
2. Do #1 above, but also insert a mid-roll commercial message for yourself or your services. Doing mid-roll ads without being annoying takes additional skill and that's why I put it second in this list.


Now this question arises: if you've never done a podcast before, can you really figure out your reason-why in the abstract? 

Maybe. Or maybe you just have to try it and iterate your way to a podcast that's aligned well with a strong reason-why. I think we'll get some clarity on this question as we now return to the larger question here: How can you make the topic of your podcast interesting?

You can't answer that question without also answering this question: _who is your podcast for_?

In fact, this is really the _first_ question you need to ask and answer. I presented the _what_ and _who_ questions out of order earlier so I could make this point: the what question might seem more important--and it _is_ important--but the who question really is the more fundamental question.

### Who is your podcast for?

Knowing _who_ your business podcast is for will make every other question about the podcast easier--or even _possible_--to answer.

So maybe you decide the podcast's primary purpose is lead generation combined with being a free gift of knowledge. If we tried to describe most business podcasts in one sentence, that'd be the sentence.

After making this choice about the show's purpose, you still have several important questions like:

- What free gift of knowledge will be interesting or compelling to your show's intended audience?
- What form of lead generation will be genre-appropriate for them _and_ be effective at generating leads?

To illustrate the second question, I call to mind MBMBAM's gone-but-never-forgotten sponsor reads for a sex toy company. I've never laughed so hard during a podcast sponsor read. The hosts absolutely go nuts with these sponsor reads, mining every comedic opportunity the subject matter presents them with.

In the genre of comedy, this is a 100% fit. In the genre of generating leads from an audience of business decision makers, uh, not so much.

It's obvious: you can't answer these questions about show content without knowing _who_ your audience is, and not just at a superficial level! You need to understand them at a pretty deep level so you can understand what will both motivate them to become a lead _and_ respect genre boundaries so they don't ignore your show (or break those boundaries in a way that serves your purpose).

I don't have any real shortcuts for you here. I believe one of the best "moats" in the world of professional services is deep insight into your clients, and one of the best competitive advantages is deeper insight than your competitors. And just like any relationship, this kind of insight takes time and effort and dedication.

But if I had to cough up one potential shortcut for you, it's this: good artists create, great artists steal. Meaning, find out what podcasts the audience you want to reach _already_ listens to, try to understand what those podcasts are doing well, and imitate what they're doing well (but weave in your own unique approach or voice or personality or _something_ unique and "you" so it's not just a straight copy job).

## Philip is still working on answering the "what makes it interesting?" question. Please bear with him.

Let's recap. You've got (I hope) clarity on who you're trying to reach. You understand them pretty well. This drives your thinking about the purpose of your show, and certain sub-decisions like how you might handle commercial messages.

But now we squarely face the elephant in the room: topic selection. What topic(s) should your show focus on?

### What is structurally interesting?

In answering the topic question, I think it's helpful to think deeper in the form of this question: what is inherently interesting to us modern humans? What is _structurally_ interesting?

I'll leave aside things that generally don't improve the human condition, like rubbernecking at a car wreck, hearing about exciting but rare events like bank robberies, etc. In other words, 80% of the stuff that the news media focuses on.

So outside of things that stoke fear, uncertainty, and doubt, what is structurally interesting? Well, as I was whippin' up some eggs for my wife and I this morning, I came up with this list:

- Risk
- Routine/Addiction/Familiarity
- Solutions
- Secrets
- Access
- Applied Insight
- Shortcurts
- Personality/Entertainment

Let's dig into each of these a little bit. If this article happens to intersect with you at a time you're thinking of how you might design a new podcast, then check each of these forms of structural interest for compatibility with your audience and your goal(s) for your show. Hopefully at least one of them will light you up with specific ideas for a good podcast structure.

#### Risk

There are really two structural relationships to risk that can make something interesting: risk reduction, and performative risk.

Risk reduction is where you help your audience reduce or manage risk. This is inherently interesting because it aligns with one of the primary survival-related drives of the human species. In other words, learning how to reduce risk aligns with a built-in human motivation which is to... reduce risk! Now just make this highly relevant and topical to your audience and you have built-in interest in your podcast.

The flip side of the coin here is performative risk. We love to see other humans do something risky and--at a minimum--escape harm and--if possible--perform the act with beauty or grace or in some other way we find appealing.

I think of Cirque de Soleil here. A big part of the show is performative risk combined with beauty, and no matter how many times I see a Cirque de Soleil performance, it feels fresh and interesting every time. I'm not a sports fan, so take this as just a comment from the peanut gallery, but I think the entire appeal of sports could be summed up under this same umbrella of performative risk.

So what does performative risk look like in a podcast?

I think of this show called [Conversations With People Who Hate Me](http://www.dylanmarron.com/podcast). Here's the show's premise:

"As a writer and video maker who focuses on social justice issues, Dylan Marron receives a lot of negative messages on the internet. In his podcast he calls some of the folks who wrote those messages, and other times he moderates calls between strangers to ask one simple question: why? Sometimes awkward, often political, and always fascinating - Conversations with People Who Hate Me takes contentious online conversations and moves them offline."

I know, I know. The above is not a business podcast. But often interview-based business podcasts will include an element of performative risk when the host asks their guest a challenging question, or intentionally takes a stand they know is in opposition to their guests viewpoint, or something like that. I think of Kara Swisher's generally assertive, sometimes provocative interview style.

Incidentally, performative risk is what gives public speaking its rapid trust-building power. The risk part doesn't substitute for having something worth saying and worth your audience's time and attention, but it does augment the power of having something meaningful to say.

Performative risk can devolve into gimmicks, but it can also be source of evergreen interest.

#### Routine/Addiction/Familiarity

Routine, addiction, and familiarity have the same effects as something interesting.

A personal example: I am _addicted_ to caffeine, and I am _interested_ in playing guitar. If you look at my meta behavior patterns around these two things, they are very similar.

I prepare for playing the guitar by undertaking various activities: buying tools and materials, learning techniques, etc. I prepare for my twice-daily caffeine addition in very similar ways: lately, buying tools like a conical burr grinder, trying out different coffee roasts, experimenting with grinding and pouring technique, etc.

See the similarity? At a fundamental level, an addiction doesn't look that different than an interest.

So it's not untrue to say you can make something interesting by making it addicting, or if someone chooses to make it a part of their routine or if they start to enjoy that thing's familiarity. The end result is the same: they'll stick with it.

I realize full well that many addictions are harmful or destructive. And I realize the very idea of addiction itself implies the addicted is not in control of their behavior, and that can be harmful in itself.

But the _mechanics_ of addiction can be seen in a neutral, or even positive, way. 

How might a podcast become addicting to its audience, or how might it hook into routine or familiarity? Some ideas:

- My now-on-haitus podcast The Consulting Pipeline Podcast was at its height of addictive power when I _published daily_.
- _Variable ratio reward schedules_ tend to be addictive. Gambling businesses figured this out a LONG time ago, and slot machines are the perfected entelechy of this idea. What if your podcast incorporated the same principle?
- _Publishing on a rigorously predictable schedule_ could build a new routine or hook into an existing routine for your listeners.
- _How your listeners feel after listening to your podcast_ might contribute to it becoming a familiarity anchor for them.

This whole idea of making your podcast addicting or part of a routine or a familiarity anchor is subtle nuanced stuff, but I include it here because it really is a big part of how we humans decide where to deploy our attention and effort, and knowing that may help you create a more interesting podcast.

#### Solutions

We humans also have a default solution-seeking behavior. We just seem wired to seek solutions to problems we are aware of and feel some urgency around solving.

If your podcast can be part of a solution your audience is urgently interested in, then you have made your podcast structurally interesting to them.

This approach to building in interest is perhaps most compatible with the "Free gift of knowledge" reason-why for a podcast.

#### Secrets

How many sales copy headlines containing the word "secret", or promising to teach you the secret to $THING (getting more clients, doubling your rate, writing proposals that win, etc.) have you seen? In this context, a secret is a tease for some sort of promise. If the tease can be paid off in a substantive way, fine. If not, it's a cheap tease that weaponized your curiosity against you.

We're moving onto shaky ground here. Experienced direct response marketers will tell you that curiosity is one of the most powerful motivations for buying. And they might be right! I've certainly bought things merely because I was curious and wanting to experience it firsthand.

But using curiosity can easily turn your efforts to connect and build trusting relationships with prospective clients into a circus sideshow.

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_0058-email.jpeg)

Much of the reason I listen very regularly to Conversations With Tyler is curiousity. I don't think an interview with Eric Schmidt is going to give me a bunch of actionable takeaways for my life or business, but I am very _curious_ about what questions Tyler Cowen will ask such a famous and accomplished person, and I'm curious what sort of answers the famous person will give. Maybe there's like one insight in there that actually applies to me. That's a mediocre ROI in terms of insights, but in terms of the enjoyment I get from satisfying my curiousity--which is like scratching an gnarly itch--it's a _fantastic_ ROI.

So maybe there's a podcast topic that lets you leverage secrets and curiosity in a non-shitty way?

#### Access

OK, moving far away from shaky ground now. :)

When someone listens to an interview (in a business context), one or both of two things is happening:

- They're gaining _access_ to the thinking, stories, or sense of presence of the interviewee.
- They're getting _more or better insight_ into the interviewee than they'd be able to do on their own because the interviewer is a better interviewer than the listener is.

The combination of an interesting guest who doesn't give too many interviews and a competent or great interviewer can lead to all sorts of moments of realization and surprise for listeners.

So if you're designing a new podcast, you can design one that gives your listeners access to people, ideas, and stories they wouldn't otherwise have access to.

"_Is that that show by those hipster know-it-alls who talk about how fascinating ordinary people are? Ekhh. God._" - Summer, "The O.C."

I love that line from The O.C. The actual genius of This American Life is that it made seemingly ordinary people and their stories interesting and compelling.

I'm not saying the highly-produced format This American Life uses is the only one that will work. Far from it! A well-prepped and executed live-to-tape interview can also be super interesting.

I am saying, however, that people don't have to be famous to be interesting. A podcast can give your audience access to experiences, stories, ideas, and insights they might not otherwise have, and those things might come from seemingly "ordinary" guests.

I have been on a very long quest to find the original quote I'm about to reference, and have thus far failed. But I'm still trying. I'm five nine's sure I heard Spaulding Gray say once somewhere: "_Everyone_ is interesting if you figure out the right questions to ask them." Or it was something along those lines. And that has really stuck with me. It's informed a lot of how I approach my work. And I think embracing the idea that everyone can be interesting can lead to a really interesting podcast!

#### Applied insight

What I love so much about Ben Thompson's podcast, Exponent, is how he applies his point of view (PoV) to the river of tech news, and this combination of a relatively fixed asset (his PoV) and a moving river of events (the tech news) produces a constantly interesting show.

Reminds me of this: 

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Photo-2019-04-28-12-46.GIF)

The kayak here is like Ben Thompson's PoV, and the river is like the river of ever-changing news he has to apply his PoV to. His Pov is relatively fixed, but the river is ever-moving, and the motion of the news-river lets Ben do all kinds of intellectual tricks with his PoV that are--to me at least--very interesting. This is what I mean by "applied insight".

Insight itself might or might not be enough for a podcast. In the case of 2Bobs, it is! But sometimes the substance of the insight needs the considerable spice of current events or case studies or some specific context to bring it alive.

#### Shortcuts

A podcast can shortcut things for your audience. Specifically, it can shortcut:

- Your audience staying current on things they care about but might be overwhelmed by keeping up with original sources for.
- Your audience learning new things.

So in the first case, we have most of the super short-form daily news update podcasts, like "The Daily" from the NY Times.

Maybe your audience needs something like that? Great examples of this exist in the newsletter world (check out Last Week in AWS), and there's no reason why you couldn't serve your audience by creating a podcast that helps them stay current. They'll likely assume you're very well informed about their space, to boot, which might help flip the power dynamic in a sales conversation with any leads your podcast generates.

You can also give your audience a learning shortcut, which I often refer to as a free gift of knowledge.

#### Personality

The final source of interest is: entertainment and personality.

Some people seem to be born with it, but it is possible to learn to be entertaining. And if you have an advantage in this area, do use it! 

But I don't have much to say on this point because I think there are easier ways to make a podcast structurally interesting.

Alrighty! We're most of the way to 4,000 words here, so I think I'll wrap this installment of this series up.

Tomorrow I'll talk about something else from my TODO list for this series, which includes:

- Interviewing guests
-  DONE!
- Seasons or ongoing or miniseries
- Audience growth
- Publication questions: frequency, scheduling, etc.

1: One additional reason I won't spend any time on here is: you start a podcast primarily so you have an excuse to connect with famous people or prospective clients. I can see why folks might do this, and if this is a second-order consequence of starting a podcast, fine, but if it's the main reason for starting a podcast I can't imagine that the resulting podcast would be any good, and it again seems like pushing a rope to me.

# [PMC] Series: Podcasting, pt3

(Readin' time: 8m 15s)

Since I talked so much yesterday about structural interest, let's move onto the next related concept, which is: being a good interviewer.

To be clear, you may not need to do this for your podcast. It might be a solo show, or a 2-people talking show, or something else. But a lot of business podcasts involve interviewing, and if I can die knowing I've contributed to fewer crappy business podcast interviews, I'll die a happy man. Furthermore, the core skills of being a good interviewer have beneficial spillover effects for the rest of your business (can make you a better diagnostician, for one).

## Two kinds

"There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who believe there are two kinds of people, and those that don't." --Source unknown

As I was grinding the coffee beans this morning, I was reflecting on all the interviews I've done and wondering if it's really possible to organize them into binary pairs, or along a spectrum between two poles.

It kind of _is_ possible to do this! In the context of a podcast, the two candidate spectrums are:

1. Famous - Not famous guest
2. You're prepared - You're not prepared for the interview

In fact, we could probably turn these two spectra into a 2x2 matrix. Lets do that:

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Scanbot-Apr-29-2019-5.51-AM.jpg)

- A: Don't do this kind of interview. It makes you look like a jackass. Either prepare properly (moving you from A to B) or avoid doing do the interview.
- B: These are great, but I have some aesthetic advice for this situation below.
- C: There's a particular way you approach this kind of interview. You're less able to lead the interview, so you compensate by approaching the questioning differently. More on this below.
- D: These are also great. I also have aesthetic advice for this situation below.

So quick summary: avoid situation A. The world has enough jackasses without you temporarily appearing to be a jackass during a podcast interview! Modify your approach based on whether you find yourself in situations B, C, or D.

## Guest is famous, you are prepared (B)

My main aesthetic advice here is: look for the gaps. Aspire to be the interviewer that asks questions your guest hasn't already answered dozens or hundreds of times. Try to add something new rather than cover ground that's already been covered before by other interviewers.

In my case, this means I have avoided interviewing people I have wanted to interview because I can't think of something new or original to ask them about. Or in other cases, it means I've waited _years_--I really mean that; _YEARS!_--for the "stars to align" in a way that makes it possible for me to ask for an interview that adds something new rather than duplicates what's already been done.

Here's the problem my advice creates. Many famous guests you might interview are famous because they've published a book or given lots of talks. The very source of their fame (the book(s), talk(s), or the larger body of work those things are part of) is how most interviewers are going to prepare to interview them. That means the interviewers are "fishing from the same stocked pond", and this will cause their interviews to have a sort of sameness to them. They'll ask really similar questions because they're pulling those questions from the same source as other interviewers. 

So the problem my advice creates is: your lowest hanging fruit for prepping for an interview with a famous person is the worst way to prep for that interview, because it will lead you to an interview that doesn't stand out from others.

This is compounded by the fact that most famous people (in the business world) are most receptive to an interview ask right before and right after they have published a new book. So what you tend to get is this highly concentrated (both in terms of timeline and content) dump of interviews appearing immediately before and after publication of their book where all the interviews are kind of the same. So just at the moment where it's easiest to ask this person for an interview you have the most structural difficulty in producing an interview that's differentiated and worth listening to!

My advice again is: don't do the interview just because access to the famous person is easier than usual.

In fact, asking for an interview with said famous person but focusing on a gap topic (one that's not really related to the book they've just published, but is something they find interesting) can be a refreshing change for them. Trust me, they get tired of answering the same questions over and over again too! They do it anyway out of a sense of obligation to their mission or audience, but they do find the experiencing wearying.

We can turn this into a rule of thumb. After a famous person publishes a new book, they'll spend roughly the next year promoting it by doing lots of interviews about the book. Wait about 6 to 8 months after their book comes out and then ask them for the interview. That's the point at which they'll be starting to tire of answering the same questions all the time and your ask to focus on a gap topic will feel especially refreshing to them.

Don't let your desire to focus on a gap topic move you from B (prepared) to A (unprepared)! You still gotta prepare, otherwise you still look like a jackass.

## Guest is not famous, you are not prepared (C)

This category does _not_ make you look like a jackass because there's an implicit understanding that if the guest is not famous, it's not possible to prepare in the same way you would with a famous guest.

That said, you will approach your questioning differently. With a famous guest that you've prepared well for, you'll have a sense of what questions might lead to interesting or surprising or insightful answers. (If you don't, you haven't prepared well enough!)

But with a not-famous guest, you won't know what questions will yield these kind of answers, so I suggest you adopt what I'll call an "A-B interviewing style".

Mode A is helping your guest tell a story. Mode B is when they happen to say something you think your audience will find interesting, so you halt the storytelling and dig deeper for a lesson or takeaway or explore a problem/solution they kind of glossed over in the storytelling. When you've mined this moment for all it's worth, you switch back to Mode A and continue.

Bob Lefsetz is _excellent_ at this, although he's interviewing niche-famous people and Bob's industry knowledge and background makes him extremely well prepared for these interviews. So he's not quite operating within category C, but I want to link you to an interview with him anyway so you can get a sense of this A-B interviewing style: [podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jerry-greenberg/id1316200737?i=1000416932628](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jerry-greenberg/id1316200737?i=1000416932628)  

Howard Stern also provides many examples of this A-B interviewing style. Here's me analyzing one for you: [consultingpipelinepodcast.com/b001](http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com/b001)  

Let's briefly sketch out what this A-B pattern tends to look like:

**Interviewer**: "Tell me the story of ______________?"

**Interviewee**: \<Walks through a linear progression of events, mentions something interesting...\>

**Interviewer**: "Can I stop you there? You mentioned $THING, and I'm curious if you can tell me why you did that?"

You repeat this storytelling-digging 2-step dance until you reach a conclusion.

I've linked to it before, but it's worth re-linking to this short video piece with Ira Glass talking about this A-B storytelling format: [m.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFI9UuC\_fc](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFI9UuC_fc)

## Guest is not famous, you are prepared (D)

We find ourselves in quadrant D most often when we're considering interviewing someone who is a friend or colleague, and we've learned about their background through a process of osmosis.

There's not much to say here, except for this: try to approach the interview as both friend/colleage _and_ proxy for your audience. Your audience won't have all the context you do, so you may need to ask questions you already know the answer to in order to build that context for your listeners. Also, your audience may find interesting and unfamiliar things that you find not interesting and familiar, merely because you've known your interview subject for a while. Try to avoid having that dampen your enthusiasm for the interview.

Finally, I should contextualize what I mean when I say prepared/not prepared. Professional interviewers like Terri Gross, Howard Stern, Andrew Warner and so on are _always_ prepared. They have people who help them prepare.

The most prepared amateur interviewer I've ever heard is Tyler Cowen. Listen to any episode of his podcast Conversations With Tyler to see what I mean. If the guest has written a book, Tyler has read it. If they have written 10 books, he's read all 10. If their _family members_ have written a book, he's read that too! The dude is a machine.

You don't have to prepare _that much_, but if you're interviewing a guest with a book(s), read their damn book(s). If they've done other interviews, check out a sampling of recent ones and their back catalog. If they've done talks that are published somewhere, same advice. Check their LinkedIn profile and learn about their career. Google them.

Repeat to this mantra to yourself: "If a potential guest's body of work is not interesting enough for me to become informed about it, I will not interview them on my podcast, no matter how helpful their fame might be for my podcast."

## General interview advice

Let's close with a "lightning round" of some general interview/questioning advice. A lot of this I've said before elsewhere, but I want to summarize it here for sake of completeness.

- Open-ended questions should comprise the bulk of your questions. These questions generally start with the words who, what, when, where, why, and how.
- "Why" questions can be perceived as a challenge, so use these questions more carefully than the other open-ended questions.
- That said, "why" questions can really deliver amazing insights when used as followup questions. Ex: Your guest tells you how they did something. You ask "Why did you do things that way and not another way?" This kind of "why" question can really deliver great stuff, so do remember to ask followup questions! Maybe don't ask "why" five times in a row, but do deploy the "why" question when you think it'll possibly lead someplace interesting.
- When you're trying to set up a guest to tell you a story, the following can help:
	- "Take us back to $TIMEFRAME. What was happening then?"
	- "When did you start down this path?"
	- "Wait, can you go back and talk about the details of what happened between $EVENT-1 and $EVENT-2?"
	- "To help our audience understand, can you give more detail on $UNCLEAR-AREA?"
	- "Who else was involved?"

A big part of the appeal and power of narrative audio is these moments of emotional resonance. Even in the context of a business podcast, it's good to accentuate these moments if they occur during an interview. So don't be afraid to ask things like "how did that feel?" or "were you afraid?" or the like. And if this kind of stuff arises naturally, rather than rushing through it, allowing a beat for your audience to soak in and reflect on this emotional moment can be really powerful.

Allllrighty! I think that's a pretty solid treatment of the interviewing topic. Tomorrow I'll move on to the question of publication: how often, how to make use of seasons or miniseries, and stuff like hosting, etc.

Until then,
-P

# [PMC] Series: Podcasting, pt4

(Readin' time: 5m 25s)

I got a late start with writing today, but let's see if I can wrap up this podcasting series anyway.

I want to touch on a few final points, including:

- Seasons or ongoing or miniseries?
- Publication questions: frequency, scheduling, etc.
- Audience growth

## Diamonds are forever. What about podcasts?

Should you start a podcast with the assumption that you will keep producing it "forever", meaning with no planned end date?

Again, I direct your attention to:

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Photo-2019-05-01-08-32.GIF)

I know some folks--and some podcasts--that do feel like they will continue the same show with the same format for what feels to me like forever. So you certainly can do that.

It happens that my particular interest is in a type of marketing that has two effects: 1) it brings you great prospective clients and--critically--it _also_ 2) gives you a vehicle for rapid cultivation of your own expertise.

The second aspect of the type of marketing that I favor means that _the marketing itself is a learning experience for you_. This has always been true of me and my life: if I stop learning, I quit, sometimes abruptly, and sometimes in ways that are hurtful to others. I regret the hurt, but not the quitting.

Recently in a weekly meeting of the January cohort of [The Expertise Incubator](http://theexpertiseincubator.com), a participant said he was surprised that the program lived up to its name. He was surprised to find that publishing daily and planning and starting to execute on a research project has actually been an _incubator_ for his expertise. To be fair, part of this comes from the structure of the program, and most of this comes from his willingness to embrace the program's challenges, lean into them fully, work really hard, and challenge himself deeply. 

All this to make the point that more and more, I am personally leaning towards podcasts that have some kind of end point. The end point could be one of the following:

- **Planned based on an end date or total number of podcast episodes**. Since you would make this plan at the outset of the podcast not really knowing where things might take you in the interim, you'll probably choose a simple round number like "I'll wrap up after 100 episodes" or "I'll do this for 2 years then wind it down."
- **Un-planned, but you'll know when to quit when you get there**. This might be some variation of "I'll quit when I stop learning." Or more simply, you'll quit when you get bored.
- **A "miniseries", structured around something other than the podcast**. An example of this is: [theexpertiseincubator.simplecast.fm/](https://theexpertiseincubator.simplecast.fm/) This podcast is a sort of informal "curriculum" for The Expertise Incubator program. At the time of this writing, the podcast isn't done. I'll add more episodes. But when there is nothing more to say in the form of a casual curriculum for TEI, I'll quit updating this podcast and it'll just live at that URL until further notice.

The idea for a podcast that promotes a specific service or product (rather than just being lead gen or trust building or deepening your connection with your audience) is an idea I lifted from Brian Clark. A few years ago, he created this really interesting podcast for the launch of his rainmaker.fm hosting company. The podcast explained the worldview his new product related to, and this struck me as a great way to build interest and urgency around the launch of a differentiated product. I'd link you to this podcast, but I can't find it anywhere right now. Any readers got a link?

A fun sidenote on the topic of quitting. This might be my favorite episode of This American Life: [https://www.thisamericanlife.org/7/quitting](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/7/quitting)

## Frequency, scheduling, etc.

How frequently should you publish? Should you publish on a rigid schedule, or should you publish whenever a new episode is ready?

Spoken like a true consultant: it depends!

It depends on what you're trying to accomplish, and other decisions you make about your show.

Listeners who expect a new episode of The Daily at whatever time that publishes each day will be disappointed if the new episode is not there on schedule.

I know there's at least one listener to [Offline](http://offlinepodcast.rocks) who is disappointed if a new episode isn't there when he walks his dog on whatever day of the week we're supposed to publish. :) So even tiny niche podcasts can cultivate a loyal listenership that has woven the podcast into the fabric of their life and expects new content on a regular schedule.

So if that aspect of podcasting is important to what you're trying to accomplish with your podcast, then stick to a regular schedule.

I also have anecdotal data that podcasts that are published on the "Napoleon Dynamite Schedule" (see the aforelinked GIF) do just fine too. They attract a growing audience and generate leads and give people new options for thinking about things. The big-name podcast in this category is Hardcore History, and my friend Jonathan's Stark's [Ditching Hourly](https://www.ditchinghourly.com) podcast also fits this irregular publishing schedule and it does just fine in terms of organic growth and business impact.

So I can't make a case for you that a regular, precise schedule is better or worse than a "whenever I feel like it, gosh!" schedule. So just be thoughtful about it and go with whatever you think is best.

## Audience Growth

There are probably ways to reliably increase the size of your podcast listenership with techniques that aren't about the _content_ of the podcast. But I'm in a salty mood this morning, so you're going to get an unfairly harsh toke from me on that stuff.

**It can all die in a fire as far as I'm concerned**.

This might be my greatest flaw as a marketer, but I truly and really believe the ideals of The Expertise Incubator, which are:

1. Anything you create in this program should be **good enough to spread by word of mouth alone**.
2. Anything you create in this program--if you give it away for free--should be **good enough that some would gladly pay real money for it**.
3. You should be willing to work daily for 2 to 3 years to make ideals 1 and 2 become true in your work. In other words, you should be **OK with not living up to ideals #1 and #2 at first** so that you can build up the skills you need to ultimately achieve those ideals.

This could pretty objectively be called an "anti-growth hacker" stance.

I think if you pursue those ideals with your podcast, things are going to work out fine for you, and you'll get the audience you need for your podcast to help your business.

I will add that I am warming up to the idea that _if you adhere to these ideals to the best of your ability_, you can add growth techniques (paid acquisition, some amount of SEO, other growth-ey stuff) as an accelerant. But the growth techniques can never, in my view, be a substitute for content that's good enough that some would pay for and good enough that folks eagerly tell their friends or colleagues about it. You can't cook a meal with a bottle of charcoal starter fluid. You need the charcoal, which is freaking great content. The lighter fluid just gets you a hot meal a little quicker.

I'll end with this link, which is Liston sharing how he used Overcast ads to land a high value client and increase his podcast audience: [offlinepodcast.rocks/paid-acquisitions](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/paid-acquisitions) (the setup) and [offlinepodcast.rocks/podcast-listeners](http://offlinepodcast.rocks/podcast-listeners) (the payoff).

I hope you got something out of this admittedly grotesquely long series about podcasting. I love talking about this stuff, so if you've got questions or comments, hit REPLY.
