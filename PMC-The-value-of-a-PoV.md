# The Value of a PoV

Why is a PoV so valuable?

* Creates affinity; attraction or repulsion
* Potentially takes affinity further to the level of polarization which can:
	* Reduce cost of sale because fewer lukewarm or bad-fit clients spend time talking to you. This _could_ masquerade as weak lead flow, so further investigation would be needed to know whether it's genuinely weak lead flow or simply an ultrafine filter being applied upstream from the conversion point.
	* Be emotionally draining, but I think the benefits outweigh this
	* Increases the sense of drama, which makes you and your content more interesting
* Builds trust
	* PoV is a defensible opinion. It's not the opinion part that builds trust, but the defensibility part. The strongest defense will be data or research or something objective and provable.
	* Helps with decisionmaking, which helps position you as a leader rather than an implementor/follower. This relevance to decisionmaking isn't a default part of every possible PoV, but if your PoV relates to how important, strategic decisions are made, then your PoV is relevant to you getting strategic rather than tactical work.
* Risk: threatens objectivity?
* Cost: not easy or inexpensive to develop. Takes real "feet on the desk" and "research in the trenches" time, but definitely worth it. Nobody's just going to invite you to sit at the big boy's table if you don't do this work.
