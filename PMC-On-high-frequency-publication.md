# On High-Frequency Publication

With only a handful of missed days, I've published an email to about 2,000 people every single weekday since mid-January 2016. Along the way, I've learned a thing or two about what I call high-frequency publication (HFP). I'd like to share with you what I've learned.

Why should you care?

Well, at the risk of sounding gauche, let me tell you what it's like to publish at high frequency.

You'll see lots of folks with email marketing experience frame their email list as the most important asset in their business. You could see my list that way, but I prefer to think of any good relationship as an earned privilege, not a built asset. Through my list, I've earned the privilege of conversing with an average of 3.22 people per day since I started HFP. That's 3.22 conversations of varying length and depth _per day_ with customers, prospective clients, and folks who may someday recommend my services to others.

Do you have trouble getting prospects to speak with you? (Do you have trouble getting them to even know you exist?) Imagine what it would be like to speak with several of them per day. Not every conversation is a near-term sales opportunity, but every one is an investment in your marketing "footprint".

My ability to create value for my clients is predicated on understanding their world. As a professional advice-giver, I need to understand the constraints--emotional and otherwise--they operate within. I need to have my finger on the pulse of their world, their needs, and their dreams. Again, I get 3.22 opportunities per day to do that, and it's both an insurance policy against eroding expertise and an investment in the future value of my business.

Recently, I had an idea for a new service offering: a coaching program that focuses on advanced inbound marketing. A smashing success for the initial offering of this program would be filling 5 seats in the first group.

I wrote a series of 3 emails to my list about this program, and the issues it would be focused on helping with. I did no planning. I did not craft an elaborate content plan for this "pitch", and I set up no automation in my email marketing software. I simply talked about the thing and asked interested parties to hit REPLY and let me know if they were interested. The 11 people who did reply with interest won't all follow through with action and payment, but some will. I might fill those 5 seats with what amounts to an off-the-cuff "launch".

Am I saying that HFP lets me be lazy and sloppy in my business? Quite the opposite. At first it is a grueling practice that deeply challenges almost anyone who is willing to try it. But, after it's become an ongoing practice for you and you've figured out a few things you can only learn by doing, it's a real economic engine for your business, and it does make some things that are normally hard--like using email to sell expensive services--much easier.

Again, it feels gauche for me to talk about my usage of HFP in this way. In terms of how I actually *feel* about emailing my list every weekday, the words *privilege*, *relationship*, and *labor of love* seem much more resonant than the words _powerful economic engine_ or _asset_.  But in the final analysis, all of these are _true_ of HFP.

HFP changes your business because it changes you.

It makes you more able to connect and build trust with prospective clients and, as a result... you actually do more easily connect and build trust with prospective clients.

## What is HFP?
Here's my definition of HFP:

	* Publishing a minimum of 3 times/week on an ongoing basis.
	* Length of each thing you publish is significantly more than tweet-length.
	* Medium could be anything. 
	* Publishing platform could be anything, with some caveats I'll get to later in this paper.

The medium and platform with which you publish can be anything. Publish a 5-minute podcast each weekday? That's HFP. Upload an unscripted smartphone video of yourself teaching about something each day to a YouTube channel? That's also HFP. Send a 300-word email to a list 3 days per week? That's HFP too. Again, HFP is defined by frequency and the meaningfulness of what you publish, not by your choice of medium or publishing platform.

Can you say something meaningful in a few hundred characters of content? Possibly. People like Seth Godin do so regularly. Maybe you can too. There's no minimum or maximum length for HFP, you just need to focus on saying something that's meaningful to a specific audience. Focus, expertise, and a point of view all make HFP work better, but those are things you should give yourself permission to learn how to do "on the job". In other words, you can use HFP to *cultivate* focus, expertise, and a point of view. They aren't pre-requisites to beginning an HFP practice.

We can legitimately use the word _practice_ to describe something you *choose* to do every day rather than something--like eating or sleeping--that you generally must do. There are religious undertones to the word practice, and that's part of why I like that label for the act of publishing at high frequency. It's an activity that changes you for the better, just like religion--at its best--can.

Finally, HFP is not HFP if you do not __publish__, meaning expose what you create to the public. More on this later.

## Why Undertake the Practice of HFP?
HFP is not normal, and it certainly is not something that happens by accident. This raises the question: _why_ might you want to do it? Below I'll make my case for each reason I see for doing HFP.

### Cultivating Expertise
They say you don't really understand something until you've had to teach it. I agree.

Stephen King wrote a book I haven't read, but it has a fascinating premise. In _Under the Dome_, a small town is suddenly cut off from the outside world when an invisible dome descends over it. 

Set yourself the goal of publishing something _meaningful_ 3 times or more per week to a specific audience and you're going to hit some kind of boundary to your expertise pretty quick. It'll be like running into that invisible dome in King's novel. You can't see it, and you don't know exactly where it is, but golly do you _feel it_ when you smack your head against it.

This creates what I call a "satisfaction gap". You viscerally feel a gap between your current and desired levels of expertise, it makes you dissatisfied, and you're quickly motivated to do something about it. HFP and an embarrassing shortfall during a client engagement are the two things most able to identify missing expertise, create a satisfaction gap, and quickly lead you to cultivate deeper expertise.

If you publish in a way that encourages feedback, it's an additional expertise accelerant. Email lists are magic for this. You broadcast just like you might on social media, but the instant a list member hits REPLY, you've switched modes into a private 1-to-1 conversation, which social media doesn’t as easily afford you since the default reply mode is public. Hat tip to my friend and colleague Jonathan Stark for pointing out how magically powerful this is. The broadcast is a scalable, 1-to-many vehicle, but it immediately becomes a private--possibly very intimate--conversation the moment a list member hits REPLY. The replies will be scarce at the outset or if you publish milquetoast content, but the natural dynamics of HFP will tend to relatively quickly push you past this level towards content with a point of view. PoV content fuels conversations.

> Quick sidebar: HFP could be done using text, audio, video, or perhaps other media like clever drawings, etc. For simplicity and with apologies to those not using text, I'll just refer to the creation side as _writing_, the publication side as _publishing_, and the consumption side as _reading_ for the rest of this paper.

About those natural dynamics of HFP… There's some research that suggests that learning happens best in environments that combine *tight feedback loops* and *consequences*. That's why you must *publish* for HFP to help you cultivate expertise. Yes, there would be some benefit to only writing daily, but your pace of learning would be slowed if you did not publish what you write. The publishing creates a tight feedback loop (especially with an email list) and it creates consequences.

I'm not sure what experts fear more: being wrong, or saying "I don't know".  Being wrong sucks for us, and it sucks more when it happens in public. Sorry, but that's the unavoidable yin to the yang of learning. Being wrong in public is the consequence that accelerates your learning. And as you're probably already thinking, the high frequency of publication creates the tight feedback loop.

Are there other ways to cultivate expertise? Sure! However I don't know any self-directed methods that are *faster* than HFP, at least for moving beyond the superficial layer of expertise that characterizes most generalist software developers.

#### Scenius

What seems like a zillion years ago in 2008, _Wired_ published a Kevin Kelly article on the phenomena of "scenius". Here’s an excerpt that explains the idea:

> Scenius is like genius, only embedded in a scene rather than in genes. Brian Eno suggested the word to convey the extreme creativity that groups, places or "scenes"  can occasionally generate. His actual definition is:  "Scenius stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius."

> Individuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire you. 

-- [Scenius, or Communal Genius | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2008/06/scenius-or-comm/)

I know it may be hard to believe, but HFP combined with a good feedback mechanism, like an email list, creates your own scenius. No, it probably won’t equal the scenius that gave rise to the British Invasion in music or the seemingly unending parade of technology that was invented in Bell Labs, but the dynamics of a group accelerating your expertise will actually be there, and you’ll notice and benefit from that.

#### Point of View

I know quite a few practitioners of HFP, and of those who have a business like mine and yours (solo consultant or very small team), none of those practitioners have any kind of "content plan" for their HFP. They choose topics based on what’s currently interesting to them, questions their audience are asking, or short term business initiatives like promoting a product or service. We all certainly use simple tools--like a list of topic ideas or questions to answer--to stay organized, but there’s no rigid calendar or sequence or long-term plan.

This creates a certain fluidity in topic selection. I find that this leads to cultivating a point of view (PoV), which--if that idea is new to you--you can think of as having a defensible opinion on how to solve a problem or how something should be done. As a quick meta-example, this entire position paper is an example of my particular PoV on HFP, which is a subset of my larger PoV on content marketing, which is a subset of my even larger PoV on how folks like us can most effectively connect and build trust with prospective clients.

Why does the fluidity of HFP lead to cultivating a PoV?

When you’re publishing at high frequency without a long-term plan for what to say and when, you’ll end up writing about what’s personally interesting or important to you. You’ll start with things you have _something_ to say about, and as the months and years wear on, you’ll keep circling around a set of topics that you care about.

As you do this, you’ll run into that "invisible dome" that defines the borders of your expertise and you will either go wider or deeper or both. You’ll go wider if your current expertise can’t deliver a complete solution. As an example, I had to learn some new things about how humans handle risk in order to deliver a complete solution for my clients who are trying to decide how to specialize. I expanded the "invisible dome" when I did that, and I was motivated to do so because I want to deliver an effective, complete solution to my clients and customers. As a result, my PoV on specialization now includes a sub-PoV on how risk factors in to decision making.

You’ll go deeper if your current expertise is superficial. Again, if your HFP practice includes a method for feedback or questions, you’ll get that feedback. If you get challenged on something, you’ll figure out your response to that challenge and that will become part of your PoV. If you get a question that leads you to new levels of nuance or insight, that also adds to your PoV.

Finally, the very volume of content that HFP practitioners create is an essential part of cultivating a PoV. If your starting point is a PoV that isn’t very unique, or is not well thought out, you’ll quickly realize this. It will suck to realize this, you’ll get a bit discouraged, and then you’ll get to work fixing things. You’ll keep publishing, because you’ve followed my advice to stick with the HFP practice for a minimum of 90 days, and you’ll get through it. I don’t know how exactly you will, and you definitely will feel that you can’t, but you will anyway because the process nearly guarantees it. 

If you lift weights to the point of muscle failure with the right form and frequency, your muscles will very reliably get stronger. HFP works the same way for building a defensible PoV.

### Building Trust

I hope it's not a disappointment to you that this section is full of nothing more than my _guesses_ about why HFP builds trust.

I am confident that HFP does build trust with a segment of those who regularly read what you publish. I'm beyond confident about this because I have lots of firsthand evidence. Writing daily about the topics of specialization and lead generation has placed me firmly in the "trusted advisor" category in the minds of lots of people, many of them past, current, or potential clients and book customers.

If HFP only worked this way for me, I'd doubt its trust-building efficacy, but that's not the case. At the end of this paper you'll find some other examples of others practicing HFP with equal or better results, many with much larger audiences than mine. I'm not a one-off HFP success story.

I'm going to move swiftly through my short list of guesses because, well, they're just guesses.

Who can publish daily about a single topic? A real expert, that's who. It might be a broad-ish topic, like marketing or pricing or the developments in the music industry. Even so, we know that non-experts are going to bring us superficial observations rather than the deep insights, surprising teaching stories and analogies, useful data, hard-won war stories, and the other thousands of permutations of legitimate expertise. So one guess is that--pardon my french--showing the fuck up every day with something to say about a topic builds trust, and does so relatively quickly.

The best scrap of evidence I have about this is an email (shared with permission) from list member Tricia:

> I've been wanting to email you for a little while with this little story. 

> Initially I kind of hated your emails. I sneered at them and celebrated a little every time I DIDN'T click the link to your offer (kinda sad).  After all, I didn't really know you that well (I found you via Brennan's podcast).  Thought it was a little crazy that you were emailing me every day AND had a link to your offer each and every time.  I contemplated unsubscribing, but never did. 

> Over time I started to get to know you a little and eventually like you.  Then I bit the bullet and became a customer in November, some email correspondence followed and interaction in Brennan's DYFA.  Somewhere along the way I started to love you in a non-creepy, you're-about-to-change-my-biz/life kinda way (Btw, the audio response to one of my emails is what made me an INSTANT raving fan.  I told EVERYONE about that.).

> Now I look forward to my 9:01 EST emails!  I think one came later in the day a little while ago and I actually wondered where was Philip?  I figured you were taking some time off. My two fave subject lines so far is this one and the man-boobs!!!  Such good little stories + tidbits that reinforce the positioning mindset.  Love it.

My next guess is that showing up _consistently_ builds trust. I think this has something to do with the "old brain" wherein we trust what is familiar. Yes, familiarity breeds contempt too, but that applies to *what* you publish, not *how often* you publish. In other words, be (reasonably) predictable in when you publish, but less predictable in how you approach the topic you're focused on.

Enough guessing. On to the next "reason to practice HFP", which I'm more confident about.

### Fluid Experimentation

I’ve already hinted at this in the PoV section above. In practice, HFP almost always has a fluid quality to the topic selection. Yes, you need to be more rigid about your publication frequency and that means you’ll have to be seriously disciplined about the production side of things, but topic selection is almost always quite fluid. You write about what you’re interested in, what your audience is interested in, or a combination of both.

This fluidity gives you latitude to experiment, and that experimentation can take two possible directions.

The first is _understanding yourself_.  It might look like any or all of the following:

* "Where do my interests create the most value for clients or customers?"
* "What market might I have the most to say to?"
* "Where is my ‘superpower’?"
* "What facet of my personality is best able to connect and build trust with prospective clients? Is it the sympathetic side, the tough love side, or the knowledgeable side? Or some combination of those?"
* "How deep does my interest in [topic] actually go?"

The second--if you actually have an audience--is _understanding your audience_. That might look like any or all of the following:

* "How would my audience respond to a new diagnostic service that looks like [specifics]?"
* "What things keep my audience up at night?"
* "Where is my audience paying only lip service to issues they’re not actually motivated to change?"
* "What energizes or polarizes my audience?"
* "What does my audience want to learn more about?"

Both of these lists could be extremely long, so I’ll stop here and summarize. HFP lets you experiment with offers, value propositions, and helps you more deeply understand your audience and ultimately your clients. It lets you very quickly try new things simply because in any given week, you can run a new experimental "trial" as often as you publish, though many experiments will span multiple publications because of the first rule of email marketing, which is that you never ask for something just once.

#### Rapid Prototyping

Most of the "reasons why" I’ve listed above for trying HFP are in the context of a business where your specialization is already determined and you’re cultivating deeper expertise and developing new business. HFP can also be useful before you reach that point.

Perhaps you’re a generalist and you’re facing that decision of how exactly to specialize. What market will you choose? What discipline will you offer that market? How do you differentiate yourself from others with a similar focus?

HFP could be a "rapid prototyping tool" for you, or a preparatory step before you undertake deep market research.

The Decision Making Workshop in Specialization School (<https://philipmorganconsulting.com/specialization-school/part-1-decision-making-workshop/>) regularly gets participants from confusion about where to specialize to clarity in 4 weeks, but some of you will prefer a longer timeline, or a more DIY approach to the specialization decision. If you have a specialization hypothesis (ex: "I think focusing on helping sporting good manufacturing and retail businesses compete against Amazon would be a good way to focus my business"), then you could partially test that hypothesis by committing to publishing at high frequency for 90 days. Your initial topic would be focused on that specialization. Over the course of that 90 days, you would pretty quickly see how deep this "rabbit hole" goes for you. You’d understand how strong your interest is and how substantial your expertise is. You’ll get discouraged and then discover if you have the grit to push through the discouragement to deeper and more valuable expertise. And if you do, your newly-gained confidence and growing PoV will be powerful forces in helping you develop new business in this area of focus. I know 90 days might sound like a long time to spend figuring out if a potential focus is a fit for you, but it’s certainly better than spending 6 or more months trying to close sales in a wrong-fit area of focus. All this said, I need to add a disclaimer: half of the "specialization equation" is you, but the other half is the market and whether it values what you offer. HFP can help here if you have an audience drawn from that market, but if you don’t then a 90-day HFP experiment will not tell you everything you need to know about market demand, and you’ll have to figure that part out in other ways.

Some of my clients do what I call deep market research. This is an adaptation of customer development research as popularized by the Lean Startup folks and Cindy Alvarez. A 90-day HFP practice could be a preparatory step for this deep market research because of how substantial a body of content you will create during the 90 days. This body of content can create credibility. Instead of being "a nobody" who is reaching out to strangers and asking for their time and insight via an interview, you are someone with a small but compelling body of work who is reaching out to learn more. To be clear, I don’t consider this a necessary pre-requisite to customer development research, but for some it may boost their confidence in the research.

### Building an Audience

The final item on the list of reasons why you might want to undertake HFP is that it can help you build an audience.

Some audiences already know they want to hear from you daily. Those who are building new skills tend to fall into this category. In fact, when you combine knowing that you lack a skill with currently feeling the consequences of that deficiency, you get a _voracious_ appetite for learning. Back when I needed to write proposals and I knew my proposals sucked, I was highly motivated to learn ways to write better proposals.

I signed up for as many courses as I could find on writing better proposals. Some of those were email courses, which are a variant of HFP scoped to 5 or 7 or however many days the author limits the course to. Daily tips on writing better proposals would have been equally interesting to me when I was in this voracious learning mode.

Chris Ferdinandi, who is one of the HFP examples I’ll point you to at the end of this paper, publishes a daily "vanilla JS" tip. That’s HFP, and it targets the skill-building need.

Those seeking to build new skills or augment existing skills are pre-disposed join the audience for your HFP, but remember the expertise and trust "halo effects" of HFP. In other words, those with the courage to publish at high frequency tend to be perceived as trusted experts of some kind. That in and of itself can be a reason for strangers to voluntarily agree to hear from you by joining your audience, even if they’re not trying to build a specific skill. They might instead want to "marinate" in the knowledge of an expert that’s relevant to their business even though there’s no urgent, immediate need for that expert’s help. Or they might enjoy being continually challenged or refreshed by your PoV on an issue of interest to them.

HFP is not some kind of audience-building "magic bullet". It needs to be combined with a thoughtful plan for earning the attention of those who might want to join your audience. That said, it can be a strong contributor to an end-to-end system for building an audience that is full of prospective clients and advocates for your expert status and authority.

To summarize the reasons why: you might want to start a HFP practice because it’s a powerful way of connecting and building trust, you might want to do it because of how it will change you, or you might want to do it for both reasons.

## When is HFP Right For You?

At what stage of a business is HFP likely to be worth trying?

I have to confess that when I was outlining this article I kept trying to scope this to a single ideal phase in your business' maturity, but kept failing to because I think it can be beneficial at all phases. You combine that with the fact that I think we should all take action before we feel fully ready for something new, and you’ve got me advocating for a lot of people in a lot of different situations to just give HFP a try.

That said, some of the "why’s" above clearly imply moments, or inflection points in your business when at least a 90-day HFP experiment might be very well-timed:

		* When experimenting with a potential new market position
		* When you're ready to get serious about your expertise
		* When you're ready to get serious about email marketing

A few words about getting serious about email marketing.

Email marketing almost always lands in the top few spots on industry "marketing tactic ROI" surveys. That’s always been interesting to me, and everything I’ve done with email marketing has been me trying to adapt for my own business what I’ve seen others doing or talking about doing. I’ve tried and ultimately combined what I consider to be two different approaches, which I’ll describe in a moment.

For a long time, there’s been an idea of what’s "standard" in email marketing. The standard is weekly emails that provide some kind of value to your email list. Framed in the negative, you’re trying to do something--anything!--to keep your email list from going "cold". Framed in the positive, you’re trying to stay "top of mind" and provide something of value to your list members so that you’re remembered and considered for future needs or recommend when someone outside the list seeks a referral from someone on the list.

The deviations from that standard are the two different approaches I mentioned above. The first approach is an automation-heavy approach, and the second, which I’ve been subtly and not-so-subtly advocating here, is HFP. You could think of HFP as a time and resource-intensive approach. I’ve heard some folks--usually those who are selling something related to email automation--refer to it somewhat derisively as a "content treadmill".

The automation-heavy approach makes use of the fact that most email service providers (ESPs) have added fairly robust automation features to their core product. In the same way that Facebook can serve hyper-targeted ads based on user demographics and behavior, most ESPs can do something similar with email. The idea behind an automation-heavy approach is the same idea behind hyper-targeted advertising. You’ll invest relatively infrequently in "creative" (in the case of ads, that’s the ad content, and in the case of email marketing, that’s the content of one or more email sequences you use over and over again), and use data collected on your list members to hyper-target them with the appropriate email sequence. At this point you can pretty clearly see the difference between the automation-heavy approach and HFP.

I think in some situations you can make the case that the automation-heavy approach is a more efficient use of your time. If you’re selling a standardized service that’s not reliant on deep expertise or a lot of trust, the automation-heavy approach certainly makes sense. If you want to get some kind of benefit out of email marketing with a relatively minimal investment of time, automation-heavy is probably the way to go. And if HFP really sounds to you like an unrewarding grind rather than a challenging but exciting way to deepen your expertise and build trust with an audience, then the automation-heavy approach will certainly better fit your preferences.

As I mentioned earlier, you can combine both approaches. I use email automation to deliver an email course, pitch my book at a discount, and then "onboard" folks to my email list, at which point they join an ongoing broadcast-based stream of HFP content. So clearly I’m not against email automation, but I do think you need to think carefully about which approach--or what fusion of both approaches--is best suited to your goals.

## Other Issues With HFP

I need to cover a few more issues to complete this discussion of HFP. This will be a bit of a grab-bag of secondary but important issues, so here goes.

I'm not convinced you need an audience to start an HFP, though it does help because it can give you that tight feedback loop from day 1.  Again, HFP can be an audience-building tool, but starting HFP with no audience is a challenge because you’ll feel a bit like you’re shouting into a void. Lack of an audience is not a reason to avoid HFP, but it is adding a few extra pounds onto a "barbell" that’s already a heavy lift. All the more reason to combine HFP with an end-to-end audience-building approach. I guess that’s my next position paper topic, isn’t it? :)

HFP does force you into a "learning in public" mode, which can be highly productive. It’s intimidating, though, and I understand that very well. It brings up lots of fears (rejection! being ignored! looking dumb! failing to follow through!) but I think the most insidious fear is that you'll find out you have very little to say about your area of expertise. If you aspire to economically valuable expertise you're gonna have to face this fear sooner or later, so you may as well do it on your terms.

I'm not sure HFP is something you have to do for a long time to get benefit from, but I think it's a powerful habit to build and so you may as well go all in. If you're going to do it I would recommend that you commit to 90 days minimum. For me, it was brutally difficult for the first 90 days, and then it became noticeably easier. I think experiencing that entire lifecycle is important so that you can make an informed decision about whether to continue HFP.

HFP is not how you're advised to do search engine optimization (SEO). It might be the complete opposite. That's OK. If SEO is really that important to your business you'll find a way to achieve that goal. Do consider the deal you're taking when you prioritize SEO: The "blue tigers" (Google, Facebook, Twitter) set the rules and you compete with others to follow those ever-changing rules in something that looks to me like a race to the bottom. For solo and very small businesses, investing in SEO can compete with time that could otherwise be invested in building core expertise.  SEO considered on its own looks like "free traffic" and who doesn’t want that, but SEO considered in the context of other activities might not be a great ROI for your business. Do your due diligence before chasing "free traffic".

It’s perfectly reasonable to ask: "when do I _stop_ doing HFP?". I and others I know have found it literally addictive because of the benefits I’ve described above, but I can imagine others doing HFP as a medium-term activity:

* Perhaps as a sort of expertise-deepening "sprint" that you conclude when you’ve moved past the superficial layer of expertise.
* Perhaps, as suggested above, as a way to try out a specialization idea or prepare for deep market research.
* Perhaps as an intentional exercise to develop a defensible PoV.
* Perhaps as a way to explore a book topic or do the bulk of writing for a book "out loud" before you curate, refine, and publish the book as a final product.

Finally, if you’re wondering why I haven’t touched on the time requirements of HFP, I’ll simply say that if you’re saying to yourself "I don’t have the time for HFP" then it can only mean your business isn’t profitable enough, you’re not disciplined enough, or genuine expertise isn’t a core part of your service offering. Sure, you could spend 4 hours a day on HFP, but you don’t really need more than 40 minutes/day for it. Don’t want or need HFP in your business? That I understand. But "don’t have time for it"? That’s a dishonest answer I won’t accept from anyone who has paid me to help them.

## Live Examples of HFP

To conclude this paper, below are some very good examples of experts practicing HFP (if I’ve left you off please let me know, I’d be happy to extend this list with worthy additions).  I’ll avoid any commentary and simply encourage you to sign up for each person’s list. You’ll see a cross-section of multiple approaches to HFP and get a feel for what it’s like to be on the receiving end of HFP. That’s really the ideal starting point. See what it’s like to be a HFP reader, and if you like that then more further into possibly doing it.

I’m shocked at how long this paper is. I absolutely intended to write maybe 2 thousand words on the topic, and here we stand--despite my best efforts to edit it down--at a shade over 6 thousand words. This is at least proof of how compelling this topic is to me. Maybe it’s proof that HFP is a PoV accelerator. I hope it’s proof that HFP is worth your consideration on the basis of its expertise-cultivation and trust-building benefits. I really do think it could revolutionize your business if you’re willing to give it a try.

I’d like to thank David Baker, Jonathan Stark, and Liston Witherill for their generous and insightful feedback on this paper. They helped me @TODO
