So, you've got an email list of ~2,000 people. Yay!

But, it's mostly the wrong people. Boo! 

This might look something like the following:

1. They were the right people, but now they're the wrong people because your business changed.
2. They were never the right people because you did shitty marketing stuff, got wise, and now realize you have a bad list.
3. The mix of right/wrong people on your list is skewed towards wrong, and you'd like to filter somehow to increase the density of right people on the list.

What do you do?
