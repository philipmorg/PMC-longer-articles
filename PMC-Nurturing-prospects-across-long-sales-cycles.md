# Nurturing prospects across long sales cycles

The term sales cycle has always been wired to me. In the strictest sense a cycle is a process that ends where it began, which would seem to exclude any sale that doesn’t lead to yet another sale but hey I didn’t invent these terms. 

Anyway, a coaching client of mine has ridiculously long, nebulous sales where clients are like "hey, can you help us like totally transform using open source really soon" and of course this turns into an existential conversation about the meaning of words and unanswerable questions about roles and responsibilities. My client does close ales like this routinely, but they take an indeterminate and often LONG time to close. 

How to nurture these prospects in the meantime? Meaning, how to keep the conversation going over months/quarters/years?

I mean, you could just hope they remember you when they’re ready. But why not do more? This won’t keep your pipeline totally predictable, but it should help a bit with that.
