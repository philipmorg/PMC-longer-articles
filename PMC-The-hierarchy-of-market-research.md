# The Hierarchy of Market Research

There’s a hierarchy of market research. Organizing your market research according to this hierarchy allows you to pick the low-hanging fruit first, reducing the total amount of time and effort you have to invest into research in order to get the answer you seek. This might let you iterate through more ideas more quickly, or reach clarity so you can start selling sooner.

* The hierarchy
	* At a high level
		* Google-able information
		* Conversations at a distance (forums, etc.)
		* Firsthand conversations
	* At a more detailed level
		* Google-able info
			* Find national-level conferences in the vertical and look at the talks that have b​een given over the past year or two. The topics of the talks can sometimes but not always be a source of insight into what the market cares about.
			* Find any professional services firms at all that are specialized in the vertical. Marketing, law, management consulting, and accounting firms all count. Look at their marketing to see if they are talking about issues specific to the vertical. They should be, but sometimes they aren't. Still worth a look.
			* Look on Amazon for business books written for the vertical. Look at the ToC for any issues specific to the vertical that you can identify.
			* Find any professional associations that you can online. (ex: if your vertical was manufacturing, this would be one such association: http://www.nam.org/). See if they publish research or other useful info. (ex: NAM does: http://www.nam.org/Data-and-Reports/Reports/). Sometimes this content is useful insight into the issues of the day for the vertical.
